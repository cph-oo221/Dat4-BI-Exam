This will involve trying to train different machine learning models, to see how precisely these patterns can be used to predict how much carbon is emitted based on the correlating factors.\\nWe will try to answer the following questions: \\n\\n- Which are the most decisive factors for carbon emissions for an individual?\\n- Does internet usage directly affect total carbon emissions?\\n- Does the important factors differ between males and females?\\n- Does people who see themselves as \"energy efficient\" generally have lower total carbon emissions?\\n- Are the people travelling frequently by plane, the ones who are emitting the most carbon?\\n- Which machine learning methods did you choose to apply in the application?\\n- How accurate is your solution of prediction?\\n- Which were the challenges in the project development?\\n\\n# Data Preparation\\n\\n### Data Collection / loading:\\n\\n### Data cleaning and exploration\\n\\nIt looks like it follows a kind of skewed normal distribution, with a few outliers lying greatly above the mean\\n\\nThe biggest correlation with carbon emissions, seem to be the monthly travelled distance by personal vehicle. Other factor with clear correlations seem to be type of transport, vehicle type and frequency of travelling with airplane. There also seem to be a smaller correlation with the amount of clothes people buy.\\n\\nDoes internet usage have an impact on carbon emissions?\\n\\nThere is a slight correlation, but nowhere near enough to asser any tendencies. We are lucky computer people!\\n\\nLet\\'s see if theres as difference between male an female patterns\\n\\nThere doesn\\'t really seem to be a difference of how much the factors weigh between males and females\\n\\n### Outliers\\n\\nAs we can see, the distribution of distance travelled by vehicle is very skewed, with 75% of the data lying beneath 3000 km pr month, with quite a few outlier being outragerously above the median. This might still be an accurate representation though, since some individuals just might travel that much. \\nWe\\'ll keep it for the variance\\n\\nLet\\'s see if people are as accurate as they think, when they say they\\'re energy efficient!\\n\\nWe can see that people say that the are energy efficient generally tend to have a little bit lower carbon emission in total, but the difference really is only about 1,5% lower than the \\'No\\' category.\\n\\nThe total sum of carbon emissions seems to be higher by people declaring that they\\'re being energy efficient, indicating that a lot more people think they are being efficient than not, while not really making any difference in the emitted carbon dioxide!\\n\\n### Plane travel\\n\\nWe can see theres a small correlation between the Frequency of air travel, and their carbon emission, let\\'s sxplore what it means\\n\\nAs we can see, the distribution of people is fairly equal between all different categories of flight frequency, but there\\'s a clearly tendency of higher average carbon emissions from people who are in the \\'very frequent\\' category.\\n\\nThe mean carbon emssions are around 22% higher for people who travel very frequently by air.\\n\\n\\n## Supervised Machine learning\\n\\nLet\\'s try and see if we can predict total carbon emission values by training different classifier models.\\nSince we\\'re doing classification, we\\'ll bin the carbon emission numbers into categories\\n\\n### Model training\\n\\nThe XGBoost model looks to have the best accuracy, with a score of 0.9747 on the test set, with only a MAE of 123.98. This is more then likely beacuse of the model ability to be regularization, both L1 and L2 to handle overfitting. Not only that, but  also how its build on top of gradient boosting framework, tree pruning, handling missing values, cross-validation and parallel processing.\\n\\n#### Naive Bayes model\\n\\nAn accuracy of about 70 percent, not bad for a first try, but I think we can do better.\\nLet\\'s try to focus on the correlating values\\n\\n#### Validation\\n\\nIn the end, it made a bigger difference to adjust the test set size to around 15% of the set\\n\\n### Decision Tree Classifier\\n\\n#### Validation\\n\\nEven better than before. Maybe our predictions can be even more accurate by using several decision trees\\n\\n### Random Forest Classifier\\n\\n#### Validation\\n\\n### Classification summary\\n\\n**Iteration 1**\\n- No data normalization\\n- 5 equally divided bins <br />\\n\\n80% accuracy (RFC)\\n\\nAt 80% accuracy the random forest classifier seems to be the most accurate model we have tested. It seems to correctly categorize a lot of the lower emitting categories, and is a little less accurate on cases with fewer instances. It\\'s still making some big mistakes which might not show up in the overall calculated score, but is very significant.\\nFor example, none of the models have succesfully caught any people in the topmost carbon emitting category. Perhaps implying, that the category data sould be binned differently, becuase if only very few instances fit into the bin, the model might not have any chance of recieving enough training data to be able to recognize the extreme cases.\\n\\n**Iteration 2**\\n- Data transformed to normal distribution\\n- 4 equally divided bins\\n\\n87% accuracy (RFC).\\n\\nModel accuracy have improved in accuracy. I accredit this to the fewer bins and the now normal distribution of the data. Even though the accuracy seems higher, the result is still unsatisfactory since it fails to identify any extreme cases in both high and low end. Because of the normal distribution transform, the data have accumulated around the mean, resulting in only around 2% of the data fitting in the extreme bins. The training data might still be to sparse to let the model identify these few extreme cases\\n\\n**Iteration 3**\\n- Data transformed to normal distribution\\n- 3 equally divided bins\\n\\n92% accuracy (RFC)\\n\\nModel have once model improved in accuracy. Even with only 3 bins, the middle bin is responsible for 92% of the data. The fewer amount of bins, gives better results when identifying outlier cases, but it is still very overfitted and not very useful\\n\\n**Iteration 4**\\n- Data transformed to normal distribution\\n- 4 bins divided by quantiles\\n\\n67% accuracy (RFC)\\n\\nAccuracy has dropped to 67%, but seems to catch a lot more of the extreme cases, now the bin sizes have been adjusted. It now represents the data tendencies way better, and are less overfitted.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Neural Network\\n\\n### Neural Network Results\\n\\n [x1,... xn] means the numbers of neurons for each layer in the network\\n\\n<table><tr>\\n<td>\\n\\n|Layers                      | Epochs | Accuracy | Test Loss | MAE     |\\n|----------------------------| -------| -------- | ----------| --------|\\n|1 lay [32]                  | 50     | 0.6514   | 485.4101  | 488.3452|\\n|1 lay [64]                  | 50     | 0.6794   | 458.6350  | 457.2778|\\n|1 lay [128]                 | 50     | 0.7634   | 360.0965  | 358.2312|\\n|1 lay [256]                 | 50     | 0.8073   | 314.0002  | 303.8010|\\n|1 lay [512]                 | 50     | 0.8387   | 277.7811  | 267.3893|\\n\\n\\n</td><td>\\n\\n|Layers                      | Epochs | Accuracy | Test Loss | MAE     |\\n|----------------------------| -------| -------- | ----------| --------|\\n|2 lay [32, 64]              | 50     | 0.8260   | 305.7189  | 287.4525|\\n|2 lay [64, 128]             | 50     | 0.8519   | 280.6377  | 259.1389|\\n|2 lay [128, 256]            | 50     | 0.9222   | 195.7561  | 177.1057|\\n|2 lay [256, 512]            | 50     | 0.9588   | 154.8777  | 133.3263|\\n\\n</td></tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n<td>\\n\\n|Layers                      | Epochs | Accuracy | Test Loss | MAE     |\\n|----------------------------| -------| -------- | ----------| --------|\\n|3 lay [32, 64, 128]         | 50     | 0.8919   | 219.7377  | 210.3670|\\n|3 lay [64, 128, 256]        | 50     | 0.9469   | 167.5058  | 152.9221|\\n|3 lay [128, 256, 512]       | 50     | 0.9755   | 126.4031  | 104.1510|\\n|3 lay [256, 512, 512]       | 50     | 0.9800   | 115.4065  | 81.7558 |\\n\\n</td><td>\\n\\n|Layers                      | Epochs | Accuracy | Test Loss | MAE     |\\n|----------------------------| -------| -------- | ----------| --------|\\n|4 lay [32, 64, 128, 256]    | 50     | 0.9787   | 117.9240  | 108.2563|\\n|4 lay [64, 128, 256, 512]   | 50     | 0.9792   | 117.7210  | 94.6650 |\\n|4 lay [128, 256, 512, 512]  | 50     | 0.9713   | 134.8475  | 80.8660 |\\n|4 lay [256, 512, 512, 512]  | 50     | 0.9819   | 109.2275  | 75.5905 |\\n\\n</td></tr></table>\\n\\n<!-- |19 lay [all 32] | 50     | 0.974    | 126.68 | v| -->\\n\\nNB: Source used for helping to make this neural network: [Neural Network Regression Implementation and Visualization in Python](https://medium.com/@nandiniverma78988/neural-network-regression-implementation-and-visualization-in-python-d5893713ed79)\\n\\n#### Approach (simple model)\\n\\nThe approach was to start with a simple model, and then add complexity over time to try to increase the accuracy of the model. At the beginning, we chose to start with only one hidden layer and 32 neurons, and then each time increase neurons with the power of 2. We made the assumption that the max number of neurons in a layer should be 512 to avoid overfitting, beacuse we know that more neurons means that the model has a higher capacity to learn form the traning data; however we dont want the model to learn from noise and other irrelevant factors, which can lead to overfitting.\\n\\n#### Configuration\\n\\nThe 4 performance metrics of the neural network with varying configurations over 50 epochs of layers and neurons are shown in the table above. This config are defined by the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer. For all iterations, we chose the activations function: ReLU:\\n```math\\nf(x) = max(0, x)\\n```\\n\\n#### Results\\n\\nThe results show that the accuracy of the model increases with the number of layers and neurons. We can see that the accuracy of the model is 0.9819 with 4 layers (256, 512, 512, 512 neurons) The test loss is 109.2275 and the mean absolute error is 75.5905. This is the best result we have achieved with the neural network.\\nWe can also conclude that the neural network has better results the our XGBoost model, that \\'only\\' got an accuracy of 0.9747 and a MAE of 123.9864.\\n\\n\\n#### Alterantive improvements\\n\\nWithout a doubt, we know that our neural network has a good accuracy 0.9819 and a littel MAE on 75.5905. However, we can still alot of different was to try and improve the model.\\nThe different tings that can be experimaneted with are the following:\\n- The number of epochs\\n- The number of layers\\n- The number of neurons in each layer\\n- The activation function\\n\\n## Unsupervised machine learning\\n\\n### Applying the data to K-means, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN & Mean Shift\\n\\nThe perpose of applying these clustering models, is to see if, there are patterns in the data, that we haven\\'t been able to see ny the numbers only.\\n\\n### Hierarchical clustering\\n\\n### K-means\\n\\n#### Multible cluster model testing\\n\\n#### Clustering summary:\\n\\nWe have try using K-means, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN & Mean shift to see if there are any patterns in the data, but it seems that there are no clear patterns in the data, when applying these clustering methods to the hole dataset. We have tried with and without scaling the data. Additionally, we have tried to use different numbers of clusters, but the results are still the same. \\nThis is concluded based on the visualisation of the clusters from the different methods due to the visualistations being porly; However, the silhouette score have actually been quite high, which indicates that there are some patterns in the data.\\n\\nSilhouette score (without scaling and pca):\\n* K-means: 0.727 (with 2 clusters), 0.624 (with 3 clusters)\\n* Hierarchical clustering: 0.426\\n* Mean shift: 0.727\\n* DBSCAN: indicates one clusters in the data\\n\\nSilhouette score (without scaling and pca):\\n* K-means: 0.549 (2 clusters), 0.426 (3 clusters)\\n* Hierarchical clustering: 0.542 (2 clusters)\\n\\nWe have also tried using only some parts of the datas features, these results are gives som visualisation endication of patterns.\\nThe features used for the clustering are: \\'Monthly Grocery Bill\\', \\'Waste Bag Weekly Count\\', \\'How Long TV PC Daily Hour\\', \\'How Many New Clothes Monthly\\', \\'How Long Internet Daily Hour\\'\\n\\nSilhouette score (without scaling and pca):\\n* K-means: 0.79 (with 2 clusters), 0.727 (with 3 clusters)\\n* Hierarchical clustering: 0.698\\n* Mean shift: 0.597\\n* DBSCAN: indicates one clusters in the data\\n\\nOther features combinations have also been tried, but the results gives similar visualisation and silhouette score.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTheres much interesing information in exploring this dataset, and we can definetely find a lot of patterns that is crucial for identifying which personal lifestyle factors are significant when it comes to calculationg our total carbon emission output.\\n\\n**Here is our discoveries summarized:**\\n\\n- The most significant factors for an individuals carbon emission seem to be their choice of transport. People that drive many kilometers monthly in personal vehicles are also the one who have a tendency to have the highest carbon emissions.\\n\\n- Theres a small indication that internet usage has an impact on carbon emissions to correlating factors, but no direct pattern can be concluded, so we deem it as insignificant\\n\\n- There seem to be very little difference in the correlating factors between males and females\\n\\n- People who see themselves as \\'Energy efficient\\' only seem the emit about 1,5% less carbon than people who say they\\'re \\'Not energy efficient\\', which we conclude makes it insignificant\\n\\n- People who travel with airplanes very frequently seem to emit around 22% more carbon on average, than people who never fly\\n\\nWe tried to use different classification machine learning methods to try and predict carbon output based on correlating factors, and clustering methods for trying to discov hidden patterns in the data.\\n\\nFor classification we tried:\\n\\n- Naive Bayes classifier\\n- Decision Tree classifier\\n- Random Forest classifier\\n\\nWe tried several iterations for optimizing the models by adjusting the category amount and the normalisation of the input data. In the end, the RFC model was the most succesful, with an accuracy of aaround 92% with 3 categories. However, we deem the result as unsaticfactory, since the input data still is a bit unsuited for this kind of machine learning, with 92% of the data fitting into a single category. The good accuracy is due to overfitting.\\nOn the last iteration we tried to divide the categories by quantiles, which made the model drop to 67% accuracy, but is a way more useful and less overfitted model.\\n\\nFor clustering we tried: \\n- K-means\\n- Hierarchical clustering\\n- DBSCAN \\n- Mean shift. \\n\\nThese clustering models revealed no significant patters in the data, with the DBSCAN resulting in an optimal cluster amount of 1. Higest silhouette score was 0.79 for K-means with 2 clusters; however the visulaization of the clusters from the different models were poor, didnt give any further insight to the data in the form of given patterns. Only way to get better visualizations, was to use specific features and not the hole dataset. This was without a doubt one of the challenges in the project development.\\n\\n')"

At the beginning, we chose to start with only one hidden layer and 32 neurons, and then each time increase neurons with the power of 2. We made the assumption that the max number of neurons in a layer should be 512 to avoid overfitting, beacuse we know that more neurons means that the model has a higher capacity to learn form the traning data; however we dont want the model to learn from noise and other irrelevant factors, which can lead to overfitting.\\n\\n#### Configuration\\n\\nThe 4 performance metrics of the neural network with varying configurations over 50 epochs of layers and neurons are shown in the table above. This config are defined by the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer. For all iterations, we chose the activations function: ReLU:\\n```math\\nf(x) = max(0, x)\\n```\\n\\n#### Results\\n\\nThe results show that the accuracy of the model increases with the number of layers and neurons. We can see that the accuracy of the model is 0.9819 with 4 layers (256, 512, 512, 512 neurons) The test loss is 109.2275 and the mean absolute error is 75.5905. This is the best result we have achieved with the neural network.\\nWe can also conclude that the neural network has better results the our XGBoost model, that \\'only\\' got an accuracy of 0.9747 and a MAE of 123.9864.\\n\\n\\n#### Alterantive improvements\\n\\nWithout a doubt, we know that our neural network has a good accuracy 0.9819 and a littel MAE on 75.5905. However, we can still alot of different was to try and improve the model.\\nThe different tings that can be experimaneted with are the following:\\n- The number of epochs\\n- The number of layers\\n- The number of neurons in each layer\\n- The activation function\\n\\n## Unsupervised machine learning\\n\\n### Applying the data to K-means, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN & Mean Shift\\n\\nThe perpose of applying these clustering models, is to see if, there are patterns in the data, that we haven\\'t been able to see ny the numbers only.\\n\\n### Hierarchical clustering\\n\\n### K-means\\n\\n#### Multible cluster model testing\\n\\n#### Clustering summary:\\n\\nWe have try using K-means, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN & Mean shift to see if there are any patterns in the data, but it seems that there are no clear patterns in the data, when applying these clustering methods to the hole dataset. We have tried with and without scaling the data. Additionally, we have tried to use different numbers of clusters, but the results are still the same. \\nThis is concluded based on the visualisation of the clusters from the different methods due to the visualistations being porly; However, the silhouette score have actually been quite high, which indicates that there are some patterns in the data.\\n\\nSilhouette score (without scaling and pca):\\n* K-means: 0.727 (with 2 clusters), 0.624 (with 3 clusters)\\n* Hierarchical clustering: 0.426\\n* Mean shift: 0.727\\n* DBSCAN: indicates one clusters in the data\\n\\nSilhouette score (without scaling and pca):\\n* K-means: 0.549 (2 clusters), 0.426 (3 clusters)\\n* Hierarchical clustering: 0.542 (2 clusters)\\n\\nWe have also tried using only some parts of the datas features, these results are gives som visualisation endication of patterns.\\nThe features used for the clustering are: \\'Monthly Grocery Bill\\', \\'Waste Bag Weekly Count\\', \\'How Long TV PC Daily Hour\\', \\'How Many New Clothes Monthly\\', \\'How Long Internet Daily Hour\\'\\n\\nSilhouette score (without scaling and pca):\\n* K-means: 0.79 (with 2 clusters), 0.727 (with 3 clusters)\\n* Hierarchical clustering: 0.698\\n* Mean shift: 0.597\\n* DBSCAN: indicates one clusters in the data\\n\\nOther features combinations have also been tried, but the results gives similar visualisation and silhouette score.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTheres much interesing information in exploring this dataset, and we can definetely find a lot of patterns that is crucial for identifying which personal lifestyle factors are significant when it comes to calculationg our total carbon emission output.\\n\\n**Here is our discoveries summarized:**\\n\\n- The most significant factors for an individuals carbon emission seem to be their choice of transport. People that drive many kilometers monthly in personal vehicles are also the one who have a tendency to have the highest carbon emissions.\\n\\n- Theres a small indication that internet usage has an impact on carbon emissions to correlating factors, but no direct pattern can be concluded, so we deem it as insignificant\\n\\n- There seem to be very little difference in the correlating factors between males and females\\n\\n- People who see themselves as \\'Energy efficient\\' only seem the emit about 1,5% less carbon than people who say they\\'re \\'Not energy efficient\\', which we conclude makes it insignificant\\n\\n- People who travel with airplanes very frequently seem to emit around 22% more carbon on average, than people who never fly\\n\\nWe tried to use different classification machine learning methods to try and predict carbon output based on correlating factors, and clustering methods for trying to discov hidden patterns in the data.\\n\\nFor classification we tried:\\n\\n- Naive Bayes classifier\\n- Decision Tree classifier\\n- Random Forest classifier\\n\\nWe tried several iterations for optimizing the models by adjusting the category amount and the normalisation of the input data. In the end, the RFC model was the most succesful, with an accuracy of aaround 92% with 3 categories. However, we deem the result as unsaticfactory, since the input data still is a bit unsuited for this kind of machine learning, with 92% of the data fitting into a single category. The good accuracy is due to overfitting.\\nOn the last iteration we tried to divide the categories by quantiles, which made the model drop to 67% accuracy, but is a way more useful and less overfitted model.\\n\\nFor clustering we tried: \\n- K-means\\n- Hierarchical clustering\\n- DBSCAN \\n- Mean shift. \\n\\nThese clustering models revealed no significant patters in the data, with the DBSCAN resulting in an optimal cluster amount of 1. Higest silhouette score was 0.79 for K-means with 2 clusters; however the visulaization of the clusters from the different models were poor, didnt give any further insight to the data in the form of given patterns. Only way to get better visualizations, was to use specific features and not the hole dataset. This was without a doubt one of the challenges in the project development.\\n\\n')"

       "[Document(page_content='\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nIn this project, we will apply different stastistical methods, to try and analyse patterns and correlation in different lifestyle factors. This will involve trying to train different machine learning models, to see how precisely these patterns can be used to predict how much carbon is emitted based on the correlating factors.\\nWe will try to answer the following questions: \\n\\n- Which are the most decisive factors for carbon emissions for an individual?\\n- Does internet usage directly affect total carbon emissions?\\n- Does the important factors differ between males and females?\\n- Does people who see themselves as \"energy efficient\" generally have lower total carbon emissions?\\n- Are the people travelling frequently by plane, the ones who are emitting the most carbon?\\n- Which machine learning methods did you choose to apply in the application?\\n- How accurate is your solution of prediction?\\n- Which were the challenges in the project development?\\n\\n# Data Preparation\\n\\n### Data Collection / loading:\\n\\n### Data cleaning and exploration\\n\\nIt looks like it follows a kind of skewed normal distribution, with a few outliers lying greatly above the mean\\n\\nThe biggest correlation with carbon emissions, seem to be the monthly travelled distance by personal vehicle. Other factor with clear correlations seem to be type of transport, vehicle type and frequency of travelling with airplane. There also seem to be a smaller correlation with the amount of clothes people buy.\\n\\nDoes internet usage have an impact on carbon emissions?\\n\\nThere is a slight correlation, but nowhere near enough to asser any tendencies. We are lucky computer people!\\n\\nLet\\'s see if theres as difference between male an female patterns\\n\\nThere doesn\\'t really seem to be a difference of how much the factors weigh between males and females\\n\\n### Outliers\\n\\nAs we can see, the distribution of distance travelled by vehicle is very skewed, with 75% of the data lying beneath 3000 km pr month, with quite a few outlier being outragerously above the median. This might still be an accurate representation though, since some individuals just might travel that much. \\nWe\\'ll keep it for the variance\\n\\nLet\\'s see if people are as accurate as they think, when they say they\\'re energy efficient!\\n\\nWe can see that people say that the are energy efficient generally tend to have a little bit lower carbon emission in total, but the difference really is only about 1,5% lower than the \\'No\\' category.\\n\\nThe total sum of carbon emissions seems to be higher by people declaring that they\\'re being energy efficient, indicating that a lot more people think they are being efficient than not, while not really making any difference in the emitted carbon dioxide!\\n\\n### Plane travel\\n\\nWe can see theres a small correlation between the Frequency of air travel, and their carbon emission, let\\'s sxplore what it means\\n\\nAs we can see, the distribution of people is fairly equal between all different categories of flight frequency, but there\\'s a clearly tendency of higher average carbon emissions from people who are in the \\'very frequent\\' category.\\n\\nThe mean carbon emssions are around 22% higher for people who travel very frequently by air.\\n\\n\\n## Supervised Machine learning\\n\\nLet\\'s try and see if we can predict total carbon emission values by training different classifier models.\\nSince we\\'re doing classification, we\\'ll bin the carbon emission numbers into categories\\n\\n### Model training\\n\\nThe XGBoost model looks to have the best accuracy, with a score of 0.9747 on the test set, with only a MAE of 123.98. This is more then likely beacuse of the model ability to be regularization, both L1 and L2 to handle overfitting. Not only that, but  also how its build on top of gradient boosting framework, tree pruning, handling missing values, cross-validation and parallel processing.\\n\\n#### Naive Bayes model\\n\\nAn accuracy of about 70 percent, not bad for a first try, but I think we can do better.\\nLet\\'s try to focus on the correlating values\\n\\n#### Validation\\n\\nIn the end, it made a bigger difference to adjust the test set size to around 15% of the set\\n\\n### Decision Tree Classifier\\n\\n#### Validation\\n\\nEven better than before. Maybe our predictions can be even more accurate by using several decision trees\\n\\n### Random Forest Classifier\\n\\n#### Validation\\n\\n### Classification summary\\n\\n**Iteration 1**\\n- No data normalization\\n- 5 equally divided bins <br />\\n\\n80% accuracy (RFC)\\n\\nAt 80% accuracy the random forest classifier seems to be the most accurate model we have tested. It seems to correctly categorize a lot of the lower emitting categories, and is a little less accurate on cases with fewer instances. It\\'s still making some big mistakes which might not show up in the overall calculated score, but is very significant.\\nFor example, none of the models have succesfully caught any people in the topmost carbon emitting category. Perhaps implying, that the category data sould be binned differently, becuase if only very few instances fit into the bin, the model might not have any chance of recieving enough training data to be able to recognize the extreme cases.\\n\\n**Iteration 2**\\n- Data transformed to normal distribution\\n- 4 equally divided bins\\n\\n87% accuracy (RFC).\\n\\nModel accuracy have improved in accuracy. I accredit this to the fewer bins and the now normal distribution of the data. Even though the accuracy seems higher, the result is still unsatisfactory since it fails to identify any extreme cases in both high and low end. Because of the normal distribution transform, the data have accumulated around the mean, resulting in only around 2% of the data fitting in the extreme bins. The training data might still be to sparse to let the model identify these few extreme cases\\n\\n**Iteration 3**\\n- Data transformed to normal distribution\\n- 3 equally divided bins\\n\\n92% accuracy (RFC)\\n\\nModel have once model improved in accuracy. Even with only 3 bins, the middle bin is responsible for 92% of the data. The fewer amount of bins, gives better results when identifying outlier cases, but it is still very overfitted and not very useful\\n\\n**Iteration 4**\\n- Data transformed to normal distribution\\n- 4 bins divided by quantiles\\n\\n67% accuracy (RFC)\\n\\nAccuracy has dropped to 67%, but seems to catch a lot more of the extreme cases, now the bin sizes have been adjusted. It now represents the data tendencies way better, and are less overfitted.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Neural Network\\n\\n### Neural Network Results\\n\\n [x1,... xn] means the numbers of neurons for each layer in the network\\n\\n<table><tr>\\n<td>\\n\\n|Layers                      | Epochs | Accuracy | Test Loss | MAE     |\\n|----------------------------| -------| -------- | ----------| --------|\\n|1 lay [32]                  | 50     | 0.6514   | 485.4101  | 488.3452|\\n|1 lay [64]                  | 50     | 0.6794   | 458.6350  | 457.2778|\\n|1 lay [128]                 | 50     | 0.7634   | 360.0965  | 358.2312|\\n|1 lay [256]                 | 50     | 0.8073   | 314.0002  | 303.8010|\\n|1 lay [512]                 | 50     | 0.8387   | 277.7811  | 267.3893|\\n\\n\\n</td><td>\\n\\n|Layers                      | Epochs | Accuracy | Test Loss | MAE     |\\n|----------------------------| -------| -------- | ----------| --------|\\n|2 lay [32, 64]              | 50     | 0.8260   | 305.7189  | 287.4525|\\n|2 lay [64, 128]             | 50     | 0.8519   | 280.6377  | 259.1389|\\n|2 lay [128, 256]            | 50     | 0.9222   | 195.7561  | 177.1057|\\n|2 lay [256, 512]            | 50     | 0.9588   | 154.8777  | 133.3263|\\n\\n</td></tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n<td>\\n\\n|Layers                      | Epochs | Accuracy | Test Loss | MAE     |\\n|----------------------------| -------| -------- | ----------| --------|\\n|3 lay [32, 64, 128]         | 50     | 0.8919   | 219.7377  | 210.3670|\\n|3 lay [64, 128, 256]        | 50     | 0.9469   | 167.5058  | 152.9221|\\n|3 lay [128, 256, 512]       | 50     | 0.9755   | 126.4031  | 104.1510|\\n|3 lay [256, 512, 512]       | 50     | 0.9800   | 115.4065  | 81.7558 |\\n\\n</td><td>\\n\\n|Layers                      | Epochs | Accuracy | Test Loss | MAE     |\\n|----------------------------| -------| -------- | ----------| --------|\\n|4 lay [32, 64, 128, 256]    | 50     | 0.9787   | 117.9240  | 108.2563|\\n|4 lay [64, 128, 256, 512]   | 50     | 0.9792   | 117.7210  | 94.6650 |\\n|4 lay [128, 256, 512, 512]  | 50     | 0.9713   | 134.8475  | 80.8660 |\\n|4 lay [256, 512, 512, 512]  | 50     | 0.9819   | 109.2275  | 75.5905 |\\n\\n</td></tr></table>\\n\\n<!-- |19 lay [all 32] | 50     | 0.974    | 126.68 | v| -->\\n\\nNB: Source used for helping to make this neural network: [Neural Network Regression Implementation and Visualization in Python](https://medium.com/@nandiniverma78988/neural-network-regression-implementation-and-visualization-in-python-d5893713ed79)\\n\\n#### Approach (simple model)\\n\\nThe approach was to start with a simple model, and then add complexity over time to try to increase the accuracy of the model.

The good accuracy is due to overfitting.\\nOn the last iteration we tried to divide the categories by quantiles, which made the model drop to 67% accuracy, but is a way more useful and less overfitted model.\\n\\nFor clustering we tried: \\n- K-means\\n- Hierarchical clustering\\n- DBSCAN \\n- Mean shift. \\n\\nThese clustering models revealed no significant patters in the data, with the DBSCAN resulting in an optimal cluster amount of 1.

Only way to get better visualizations, was to use specific features and not the hole dataset. This was without a doubt one of the challenges in the project development.\\n\\n'),\n",

This central message is \\nechoed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s Special Report on the impacts of global warming \\nof 1.5-degrees (IPCC 2018), as well as the conclusion of the \\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions \\nGap Report 2020 which devotes a chapter to low-carbon \\nlifestyles (UNEP 2020). Further, the upcoming IPCC sixth \\nassessment report is expected to highlight demand and social \\naspects of mitigation (Creutzig et\\xa0al. 2018). At the country \\nlevel, national and regional governments now also incor -\\nporate lifestyle and behavior changes into their long-term \\nstrategies, in parallel with technological changes. Transfor -\\nmation to a net-zero economy is “not just about technologies \\n(…but) about people and their\\xa0daily lives” and “lifestyle \\nchoices can make a real difference, while improving quality \\nof life” (European Commission 2018) and “shifting the way \\nof life (…) provides a major impact directly and indirectly \\non climate change” (Government of Japan 2019).\\nIn terms of research on lifestyle changes and climate \\nchange mitigation, the body of literature has grown but is \\nstill limited. For example, emission pathways based on the \\nintegrated assessment models (IAMs) incorporate various \\naspects of lifestyle changes; however, these need to be devel -\\noped to more comprehensively explore the impacts of indi-\\nrect emissions through the lifecycle of goods and services \\n(van den Berg et\\xa0al. 2019; Saujot et\\xa0al. 2021).

GHG \\nemissions resulting from household consumption comprise \\n58–72% of total global emissions (Ivanova et\\xa0al. 2016; Her -\\ntwich and Peters 2009). These carbon footprints consist of \\nboth direct emissions, such as the use of fossil fuels at home \\nand for driving, and indirect emissions resulting from the \\nuse of goods and services by households—which can be \\neven higher than the direct ones (Hirano et\\xa0al. 2016). Recent \\ndevelopments in this field include attempts to quantify miti-\\ngation impacts from a variety of demand-side options related \\nto food, housing, and mobility (Jones and Kammen 2011; \\nSchanes et\\xa0al. 2016; Bjelle et\\xa0al. 2018; Wood et\\xa0al. 2018; \\nIvanova et\\xa0al. 2020; Moran et\\xa0al. 2020). Despite the ris-\\ning number of such studies, however, most focus only on \\nthe potentials based on individual demand-side options and \\noffer no concrete scenarios in the form of the aggregated \\nimpacts from lifestyle changes required to close the gaps \\nbetween currently prevalent heavy carbon footprints and the \\nclimate targets. Building on these existing approaches, the \\npresent study proposes a consumption-based target for life-\\nstyle carbon footprints and also explores the extents needed \\nto change lifestyles to meet the 1.5\\xa0°C climate target of the \\nParis Agreement.\\nThis paper proposes an approach for assessing lifestyle \\ncarbon footprints and lifestyle changes aimed at limiting \\nglobal warming to 1.5\\xa0°C and facilitating the transition to \\ndecarbonized lifestyles through participatory research. After \\nintroducing per-capita targets of lifestyle carbon footprints, it \\nprovides a hotspot analysis of current lifestyles and mitiga-\\ntion impacts from individual and multiple lifestyle change \\noptions, focusing on the case studies of Finland and Japan. \\nThe quantitative results discussed are based on the key find-\\nings from phase I of the “1.5-Degree Lifestyles” project, an \\ninternational research project on decarbonizing lifestyles, \\nand its technical report (IGES et\\xa0al. 2019). Building up to \\nthe quantitative analysis, it discusses research opportuni-\\nties including subnational analysis, living lab, and scenario \\nanalysis that could be followed up on to facilitate lifestyle \\nchanges that can be taken aimed at decarbonization.\\nConsumption‑based per‑capita targets \\ncorresponding to\\xa0the\\xa01.5\\xa0°C climate goal\\nThis section explains the different types of targets and their \\nrelevance. Typically, climate change targets have been \\ndiscussed in terms of territorial emissions such as at the \\ncountry level (Climate Analytics and NewClimate Institute \\n2020), but such accounting cannot comprehensively cap-\\nture the impacts of consumption activities through indirect emissions in supply chains occurring outside of the terri-\\ntory being studied. On the other hand, consumption-based \\ncarbon footprint accounting is useful for devising policies \\nthat avoid leakage of emissions beyond territorial bor -\\nders—an approach empowering governments, companies, \\nand consumers to shape low-carbon actions at the global, \\ncountry, city, and household levels (Peters 2010).\\nFurther, most existing targets are proposed at the \\naggregated level, such as global and country totals, but \\nin the context of promoting lifestyle changes, aggregated \\nterritorial-based targets may not be explicitly relevant to \\nhouseholds and local stakeholders, since such targets are \\nnot directly linked to people’s daily lifestyles or fail to \\naccount for the indirect emissions resulting from consump-\\ntion. Therefore, consumption-based per-capita targets can \\nfacilitate actions to decarbonize people’s lifestyles, and \\ncan also reveal the gaps between predominant lifestyles \\nand levels of decarbonization required to meet the targets.\\nIn this study, we define “lifestyle carbon footprints” as \\nthe sum of direct and indirect GHG emissions induced \\nfrom household consumption, excluding government \\nexpenditure and capital investment. In relation to the \\nplanetary boundaries (Rockstrom 2009; Steffen et\\xa0al. \\n2015), few studies have attempted to downscale climate \\nchange boundaries into per-capita targets (Nykvist et\\xa0al. \\n2013; Dao et\\xa0al. 2015). Further, these targets are static and \\nfail to account for the gradual reduction in carbon emis-\\nsions anticipated to take place by the second half of the \\ntwenty-first century, as suggested by the major mitigation \\npathways aligned with the climate goals (UNEP 2020). \\nFor these reasons, the present study established consump-\\ntion-based per-capita targets of lifestyle carbon footprints \\nassuming the gradual decrease of carbon budgets to the \\nsecond half of the century.\\nThe per-capita lifestyle carbon footprint targets proposed \\nbelow are based on a review of existing emission pathways, \\nprojections of global population (United Nations 2017), \\nand share of carbon footprints of household consumption \\nin total footprints (Hertwich and Peters 2009). As shown in \\nFig.\\xa01, using the identified representative pathways towards \\nthe 1.5\\xa0°C Paris Agreement goal, and considering either \\nlimited or intensive use of negative emission technologies \\n(van Vuuren et\\xa0al. 2018;\\xa0Ranger et\\xa0al. 2012;\\xa0Rockström et\\xa0al. \\n2017 ), the upper and lower annual targets of per-capita life -\\nstyle carbon footprints are: 2.5–3.2  tCO2e in 2030, 1.4–2.2 \\n tCO2e in 2040, and 0.7–1.4  tCO2e in 2050. It should be \\nnoted that, to explicitly focus on the parts related to lifestyles \\nof citizens, these targets do not include footprints result -\\ning from government expenditure and capital investment. \\nHowever, accounting for such factors in allocating footprints \\ncould be taken up in future research, as they are not only \\nfactors related to satisfying the needs of a country’s citizens \\nbut also those of future generations, as well as its exports.', metadata={'source': '../data/research_paper.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

In terms of the carbon budget, the latter is \\nclose to a 2\\xa0°C target with extensive use of negative emission \\ntechnologies.\\nAssessing hotspots of\\xa0lifestyle carbon \\nfootprints and\\xa0comparing them with\\xa0targets\\nHere, we explain the approach for assessing lifestyle car -\\nbon footprints, present the results of estimations, the gaps \\nbetween current lifestyle carbon footprints and the targets, \\nand the hotspot areas of lifestyle carbon footprints.\\nAssessing lifestyle carbon footprints through considera -\\ntion of different consumption domains and components \\ncan help to identify underlying problems and potential \\nsolutions. There are two basic approaches for estimating \\ncarbon footprints. One, used in most existing studies on \\ncarbon footprints related to household consumption, is \\nmonetary-based estimation (Hertwich 2005; Tukker et\\xa0al. \\n2010; Ivanova et\\xa0al. 2016). The other focuses on lifestyles \\nbased on physical amounts of consumption, for which \\nlimited studies exist (Barrett et\\xa0al. 2002; Nissinen et\\xa0al. \\n2007; Girod et\\xa0al. 2010; Moore et\\xa0al. 2013; Lettenmeier \\n2018). In our study, we mainly used estimation based on \\nphysical amounts of consumption, since it can more accu-\\nrately model substitutions between different consumption items—such as transportation modes, energy sources, and \\nfood ingredients. This approach also facilitates a better \\nunderstanding of the consumption patterns of citizens, \\nsince it examines carbon footprint hotspots on the basis of \\nboth physical consumption amounts and carbon intensities.\\nUsing the physical-amount approach, we examined car -\\nbon footprints and characteristics of consumer lifestyles \\nfocusing on food, mobility, and housing, and examined the \\namounts quantified based on actual physical amounts of \\nconsumption. The quantities estimated were based on fig-\\nures for mobility distance in passenger-km, food consump-\\ntion in kg, and energy consumption in kWh. For the other \\ndomains such as leisure, consumer goods, and services we \\nused monetary-based estimation, to ensure we had a fuller \\npicture, or overview of household consumption.\\nWe estimated carbon footprints of average consumers in \\nfive target countries, including Finland and Japan, for nutri-\\ntion, housing, and mobility domains based on the collected \\nnational and other official statistics, such as nutrition intake \\nand food supply, transport and fuel consumption, housing \\nand water supply, and energy statistics. To estimate carbon \\nfootprints for each product and service, we used carbon \\nintensity data obtained from life cycle inventory databases, \\nwhich are widely used and provide extensive coverage of \\nitems, such as Ecoinvent (Wernet et\\xa0al. 2016), as well as \\nadditional data on carbon footprints in other domains from \\ninput–output models such as ENVIMAT (Seppälä et\\xa0al. \\n2009) and GLIO (Nansai et\\xa0al. 2012). These carbon foot-\\nprints and physical consumption amounts were aggregated \\ninto several components per domain to enable comparison \\nbetween the target countries and quantification of the impacts \\nfrom lifestyle changes. More details on the data sources are \\navailable in the technical report (IGES et\\xa0al. 2019).\\nAssessing lifestyle carbon footprints and\\xa0gaps \\nwith\\xa0the\\xa0targets\\nResults of the analysis revealed significant gaps between \\ncurrent lifestyle carbon footprints and the 2030–2050 tar -\\ngets.

The estimated lifestyle carbon foot-\\nprints and physical consumption patterns were visualized \\nas skyline charts to examine the hotspots, and comparisons \\nwere made with the per-capita targets introduced in the \\nprevious section (Fig.\\xa0 3). For each colored block (rectan-\\ngle) in the figure, its area represents the carbon footprint \\nof the item, the width refers to consumption amount, and \\nthe height shows carbon intensity. The figure also shows \\ncurrent and indicative target carbon footprints, with dot-\\nted lines showing average intensities across components. \\nHere, the allocation of target carbon footprints between \\ncarbon intensity and consumption amounts as well as \\nbetween domains is only indicative, as different forms of \\nallocations are possible. Nevertheless, even an indicative \\ntarget can provide useful insights on the extent and cover -\\nage of the changes required to meet the related target.\\nThese visualizations enable an intuitive understanding \\nof the hotspots of lifestyle carbon footprints based on phys-\\nical consumption, either due to large carbon footprint (size \\nof the area) or high-carbon intensity (large height)—for \\nexample, consumption of meat, energy from fossil fuels, \\ncar-driving, and flights. Moreover, comparison with tar -\\ngets in each domain can deepen our understanding of the \\nlevels and types of changes in lifestyles and provisioning \\nsystems that will be required. To illustrate, in the mobil-\\nity domain, rapid reduction of both transport distance and \\nintensity may be needed to comply with the 1.5\\xa0°C target \\n(comparing the size of black, pink, and light blue dotted \\nline boxes). Apart from the larger blocks (height of gray and red blocks) shown in this domain, it is noteworthy that \\nthe carbon intensity of even current bus services (height \\nof dark blue block in comparison with pink/light blue dot-\\nted line target boxes) makes them not compliant with the \\ntargets in the future.\\nThese points illustrate the need for a transition in con-\\nsumer lifestyles to comply with the climate target.

In this \\nstudy, incorporating a framework based on existing lit-\\nerature (Nelldal and Andersson 2012; Figge et\\xa0al. 2014; \\nAkenji et\\xa0al. 2016), we classified the major approaches \\nused for reducing carbon footprint by lifestyle changes \\ninto three basic types: (1) Absolute reduction: reducing the \\namount of physical consumption of goods and services; \\n(2) Efficiency improvement: reducing the emissions by \\nintroducing alternative lower-carbon technologies, while \\nkeeping the same mode of consumption and amount; and \\n(3) Modal shift: substitution of a consumption mode by \\nanother less carbon-intensive mode, while keeping the \\nsame amount of functional demand.\\nFig. 2  Gaps between current \\nlifestyle carbon footprints of \\naverage citizens in countries \\nand 2030–2050 targets.

To do this, we first \\nidentified the lifestyle change options that would have the \\nmost impact by literature review, then quantified around \\n30 options per country. Calculations were made based on \\nthe three approaches proposed above and the lifestyle car -\\nbon footprint and physical amounts of consumption esti-\\nmated in this study. Absolute reduction can be modeled \\nby reducing physical consumption amounts, and efficiency \\nimprovements can be reflected by reducing carbon intensi-\\nties in the dataset. Modal shifts can be quantified by shift-\\ning amounts of consumption of particular items to another \\nitem, as each has a different carbon intensity.\\nWe focused on quantifying the maximum potential of \\nfootprint reduction assuming full adoption (100% adop-\\ntion rate) of an option—for example, commuting without \\nany car or always eating vegetarian meals—but also show \\nresults for partial adoption of options. This is because in \\nthe real world, households are more likely to only make \\npartial use of commuting by bicycle or vegetarian meals, \\nor only a part of the population might adopt these options. \\nFigures for partial adoption were calculated by multiplying \\nfull implementation impacts by the adoption rate.\\nFigure\\xa0 4 shows the lifestyle change options identified. \\nThe most effective options include private travel with-\\nout a car, shifting to renewable electricity, electric cars, \\nvegetarian diets, and vehicle efficiency improvement \\n(potential of each option if fully implemented: 500\\xa0kg to \\nover 1500\\xa0kg  CO2e per capita on average). Other effective \\noptions include ridesharing, living close to the workplace, \\ntemperature control using heat pumps, commuting with-\\nout a car, use of dairy product alternatives, low-carbon \\nproteins, and living in smaller spaces (250–500\\xa0kg  CO2e \\nper capita).\\nThese results also highlight the importance of cover -\\ning all three approaches discussed in this paper: absolute \\nreduction, modal shift, and efficiency improvements. For \\nexample, many of the most impactful options with mitiga-\\ntion potentials over 500\\xa0kg  CO2e per-capita adopt the modal \\nshift approach, such as shifting from cars to public transport, \\nfrom conventional to renewable energy, from gasoline to \\nelectric cars, and from meat-rich to vegetarian diets, but also \\non the efficiency improvement approach, such as using effi-\\ncient vehicles and ride sharing. Absolute reduction options \\nare also prominent among the effective options identified, \\nsuch as reducing mobility distance, living space, and hot \\nwater consumption.\\nAs illustrated in the figure, the mitigation potentials differ \\namong the case countries. This implies that the effective -\\nness of lifestyle change options depends on each context, such as differences due to actual physical consumption pat-\\nterns, e.g., car driving, meat and dairy product consumption, \\nenergy consumption, and grid electricity mix. There are also \\nbackground reasons, such as different structures in provision, \\ninfrastructure, and habits of consumers. Therefore, options \\nsuch as car-free travel and dietary shift have larger mitiga-\\ntion potentials in Finland, whereas other options such as \\nrenewable electricity are more effective in Japan.\\nAggregated mitigation impacts from\\xa0lifestyle \\nchanges\\nTo better understand the level and types of demand-side \\nactions needed to meet the 1.5\\xa0°C climate goal, we investi-\\ngated lifestyle changes beyond the individual option of life-\\nstyle changes, through quantifying the aggregate mitigation \\npotentials from multiple options covering all the consump-\\ntion domains of food, housing, mobility, goods, leisure, and \\nservices. Adding up the impacts from more than one lifestyle \\nchange option does not produce accurate aggregate figures \\ndue to areas of synergy and overlap. Therefore, aggregated \\nimpacts from multiple lifestyle change options were quanti -\\nfied by considering the overlaps and synergies. As an initial \\nattempt to examine the level of required changes, we made \\na basic assumption that all selected options were adopted \\nat the same rate. The analysis results (Fig.\\xa0 5) revealed that \\n65–75% adoption of approximately 30 quantified options in \\ncombination with 65–75% reduction of footprints in goods, \\nleisure, and services by 2030 would be needed for both \\ncountries to comply with the upper to lower targets of 2030 \\n(2.5–3.2  tCO2e).\\nThis means that ambitious adaption of lifestyle change \\noptions can contribute to reducing lifestyle carbon foot-\\nprints towards the targets of the Paris Agreement. However, \\nthe level and coverage of required changes is both high \\nand broad due to the proximity of year 2030. In view of \\nthe 2050 targets, the analysis also concludes that even full \\nimplementation of these options with 90% reduction of \\nfootprints in goods, leisure, and services is not sufficient \\nto meet the 2050 lower target (0.7  tCO2e). This implies \\nthat much broader-ranging lifestyle change options and sys-\\ntemic changes, including large-scale behavioral changes \\ncombined with huge innovations in provisioning systems \\nmay be needed to comply with the 1.5\\xa0°C climate goal. \\nThese findings on aggregated mitigation impacts from the \\ncombination of multiple lifestyle change options under -\\nscore the need for ambitious uptake of currently available \\noptions and additional new decarbonization options, as \\nwell as structural changes in consumption habits and pro-\\nvisioning systems.', metadata={'source': '../data/research_paper.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

The analysis of lifestyle \\ncarbon footprints in this paper identified means to reduce \\nGHG emissions derived from consumer lifestyles—abso -\\nlute reduction, modal shift, and efficiency improvement. \\nIn terms of implementation, the area to be focused on \\ngoing forwards is how to capitalize on these means to \\nsupport citizens, communities, governments, businesses, \\nand other stakeholders in transforming lifestyles and con-\\ntexts of living. This can be approached from three per -\\nspectives: clarifying the impacts from lifestyle changes \\nand the gaps with the target, envisioning possible future \\nbased on consumption-based scenarios and roadmaps, and \\nfacilitating lifestyle changes in real-life settings. To date, \\nfrom the footprint perspective, only a few existing stud-\\nies adopt the participatory approach, through stakeholder \\nworkshops (Leppänen et\\xa0al. 2012; Vita et\\xa0al. 2019). This \\nsection extends the footprint-based quantitative analysis to \\nincorporate these perspectives through subnational analysis \\non carbon footprints and lifestyle changes, integration with \\nliving lab approaches, and consumption-based scenario \\ndevelopment.\\nSubnational analysis of\\xa0lifestyle carbon footprints \\nand\\xa0lifestyle changes\\nOne opportunity as an area of study is analysis of lifestyle \\ncarbon footprints and lifestyle changes at the subnational \\nlevel. The availability of data related to household con-\\nsumption is growing—not only in the conventional format \\nof aggregated statistics of household consumptions at both country- and city-level but also covering different aspects \\nof household consumption, including survey microdata of \\nindividual responses to surveys. As illustrated in this paper, \\nquantifying mitigation potentials from lifestyle changes \\nhelp to understand the effectiveness and potential contribu-\\ntions of lifestyle changes to the climate goals. However, to \\ndate, most studies on the quantification of carbon footprint \\nreduction focus on countries or regions (Jones and Kam-\\nmen 2011; Schanes et\\xa0al. 2016; Bjelle et\\xa0al. 2018; Wood \\net\\xa0al. 2018; Ivanova et\\xa0al. 2020; Moran et\\xa0al. 2020), with \\nonly a few exceptions (Hersey et\\xa0al. 2009; Dubois et\\xa0al. \\n2019). Considering the pivotal roles of cities in activating \\nsustainable lifestyles and decarbonized societies (Peters \\n2010; Wright et\\xa0al. 2011; Bailey et\\xa0al. 2019), the assess-\\nment of lifestyle carbon footprints proposed in this paper \\ncould be extended to subnational units such as cities and \\nlocal communities.\\nA similar analysis can also be extended to quantify miti-\\ngation potentials from lifestyle changes in different con-\\nsumer segments using survey microdata.

This analysis approach is especially relevant \\nconsidering the growing awareness of the inequalities, in \\nterms of carbon footprints, between consumer and income \\nsegments globally and within each country, which under -\\nscores the urgency of addressing the emissions and foot-\\nprints of high-carbon population segments (Kartha et\\xa0al. \\n2020; Ivanova and Wood 2020; UNEP 2020). The segmen-\\ntation method in existing studies can be combined with the \\napproach proposed in this paper to investigate the impacts \\nof a transition in lifestyles of different consumer segments. \\nSuch analysis can identify mitigation potentials in terms \\nof high-carbon activities and high-carbon population seg-\\nments, which are both useful when considering the equita-\\nbility and effectiveness of mitigation actions.\\nIntegration of\\xa0lifestyle carbon footprint analysis \\nwith\\xa0living lab approaches\\nThere is a need to examine the feasibility of lifestyle \\nchanges, levels of potential acceptance by citizens, and \\nnecessary supporting measures and policy actions, as well \\nas assess the impacts from a carbon footprint perspective. \\nA deeper and more realistic understanding of lifestyle \\nchanges can be obtained from the living labs approach. \\n‘Living labs’ refers to an open innovation platform with \\nreal-life environments to address societal challenges \\nthrough the collaboration of various stakeholders (Hos-\\nsain et\\xa0al. 2019 ).

Living labs may contribute to generating \\nuseful applied knowledge and inspiring rapid transforma-\\ntions in society and technology, creating not only direct \\nimpacts at the niche level but also indirect impacts through \\nadjustment of policies and provision structures, as well as \\ndiffuse impacts on cultural and normative values of socie-\\nties (Schliwa et\\xa0al. 2015).\\nThe living labs approach has numerous applications in \\nlow-carbon urban development (Voytenko et\\xa0al. 2016) and \\ndaily practices related to domains of lifestyles such as food, \\nenergy, building, work, and product use (von Geibler et\\xa0al. \\n2014; Davies and Doyle 2015; Devaney and Davies 2017; Kivimaa et\\xa0al. 2017; Jensen et\\xa0al. 2018). However, a liv -\\ning lab approach that seeks to obtain information on sus-\\ntainable actions based on energy use or direct GHG emis-\\nsions cannot fully account for the climate change impacts \\nof daily living from the consumption-based perspective. \\nTo date, a limited number of studies have used the living \\nlabs approach to focus on the life cycle impacts of life-\\nstyles, such as using carbon and material footprints (Hede-\\nnus 2011; Laakso and Lettenmeier 2016; Lahtinen et\\xa0al. \\n2020;\\xa0Greiff et\\xa0al. 2017). Although not labeled as a living \\nlab approach, the life cycle approach has also been com-\\nbined with small-scale experiments to identify effective \\ninterventions (Wynes et\\xa0al. 2018). One possible approach \\ncould involve use of a footprint calculator as well as analy -\\nsis of lifestyle changes, as illustrated by some examples of \\nonline platforms for personal carbon footprint estimation Fig. 5  Aggregated impacts from \\nlifestyle change options and \\ncomparison with 1.5\\xa0°C targets \\n(Finland and Japan).

These experimentations with \\nreal-life settings can be combined with the methodology \\nproposed in this paper to better comprehend the practicality \\nas well as necessity of certain actions, to facilitate impact-\\nful lifestyle changes.\\nDeveloping consumption‑based mitigation \\nscenarios and\\xa0roadmaps incorporating lifestyle \\nchanges\\nAs this paper shows, examining aggregated impacts by com -\\nbining multiple lifestyle change options helps us understand \\nthe lifestyle changes that are needed to meet the climate \\ngoals. Desirable outcomes in the future can be approached \\nthrough development of future scenarios and roadmaps \\nincorporating carbon footprints and lifestyle changes. Aim-\\ning towards decarbonized lifestyles, such efforts could \\nincorporate three elements: (1) consumption-based carbon \\nfootprints and mitigation potentials from lifestyle changes \\nexplicitly linked to the decarbonization target, (2) partici-\\npatory process involving citizens and stakeholders, and (3) \\nroadmaps with supporting measures through policy and \\nstakeholder actions, as explained below.\\nFirst, scenario analysis can be based on consumption-\\nbased carbon footprints and explicitly indicate pathways to \\nthe decarbonization target. To date, a number of low-carbon \\nscenarios based on direct emissions incorporating the back -\\ncasting approach have been proposed (Hughes and Strachan \\n2010). However, these scenarios cannot fully account for \\nthe indirect impacts from consumption activities related to \\nlifestyles, due to the relatively large indirect emissions. Con-\\nversely, from a consumption-based perspective, some studies \\nquantified impacts from multiple demand-side options (Vita \\net\\xa0al. 2019; Moran et\\xa0al. 2020), but these studies do not focus \\non the gap with the decarbonization targets. Only a limited \\nnumber of scenarios of future lifestyles have been developed \\nthat comprehensively consider life cycle impacts and the \\ngaps with the target levels (Girod et\\xa0al. 2014; Lettenmeier \\net\\xa0al. 2014; Impiö et\\xa0al. 2020). These methods can be fur -\\nther expanded to incorporate consumption-based per-capita \\ntargets and the methodology of modeling lifestyle changes \\nproposed in this paper.\\nSecond, future scenarios linked with lifestyle carbon foot-\\nprints can be developed through stakeholder engagement \\nprocesses such as with citizens, the business sector, com-\\nmunity organizations, and policymakers. As the forms sus-\\ntainable lifestyles will take depend on the contexts (Akenji \\nand Chen 2016), so too will future decarbonized lifestyles. \\nStakeholder engagement can facilitate actions in policy \\nand business sectors by comprehensively considering the \\nimplications for lifestyles of citizens and environmental, \\neconomic, and social consequences. The scenario making process can be used as a tool for communicating with non-\\nscientific audiences and engaging stakeholders (Raskin \\net\\xa0al. 2004). Studies developing future lifestyle scenarios \\nwith stakeholder engagement (Leppänen et\\xa0al. 2012; Vita \\net\\xa0al. 2019) can be extended to explicitly link consumption-\\nbased footprint targets to investigate the desired types of \\ntransitions. Making use of such participatory processes can \\nensure the views of citizens and stakeholders are reflected \\nin the desired actions, to achieve a high quality of life within \\nclimate boundaries.\\nFinally, the extent and level of ambition of lifestyle \\nchanges required to meet the target necessitate supporting \\nmeasures and stakeholder actions. Unsustainable patterns of \\nconsumption are deeply embedded in contexts linked with \\neveryday routines and practices (Evans and Jackson\\xa0 2007; \\nSalomaa and Juhola 2020). Systems of provisioning linked \\nwith social practices have crucial roles beyond behaviors \\nof citizens (Spaargaren and Oosterveer 2009). Therefore, \\ninstead of placing overall responsibility entirely in the hands \\nof each consumer, a transition to decarbonized lifestyles may \\ninstead require systemic actions through all stakeholder \\nactions. This calls for supporting measures through new \\nsystems of provisioning as well as policies to enable decar -\\nbonized lifestyles, which can be identified and supported \\nthrough developing roadmaps alongside the scenarios.\\nScenarios are often combined with roadmapping of nec-\\nessary actions along with timelines, as illustrated in low-\\ncarbon society scenarios (Kainuma et\\xa0al. 2012), sustainable \\nlifestyle scenarios (Leppänen et\\xa0al. 2012; Impiö et\\xa0al. 2020), \\nand technology roadmapping (Hussain et\\xa0al. 2017). Stake-\\nholder dialogues such as workshops can help incorporate dif-\\nferent perspectives in roadmapping, as illustrated in existing \\nstudies (Doyle and Davies 2013). Roadmaps to support and \\nenable decarbonized lifestyles can include various instru-\\nments and actions related to consumer lifestyles, including \\neconomic, regulatory, information, nudging, infrastructure, \\nand product and service provision. These actions should \\ncover and focus on the carbon footprint hotspots related to \\nnutrition, housing, mobility, consumer goods, leisure, and \\nservices identified in this paper.\\nThe research opportunities discussed above are mutually \\nlinked and may have synergies. The subnational analysis of \\nlifestyle carbon footprints can provide a useful background \\nthat informs in the areas of equitability and effectiveness of \\nactions in the scenarios. In addition, options identified as \\npart of the scenarios through the participatory process can \\nbe tested in living labs to identify supporting measures and \\nconstraints in real-life environments, and the learnings from \\nthe living labs approach can be reflected into roadmaps.', metadata={'source': '../data/research_paper.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",

Considering the magnitude of changes required, life-\\nstyles need to be decarbonized based on a transformative \\napproach with a focus on non-incremental changes embrac-\\ning higher-order, larger-scaled, deep and impactful, systemic \\nchanges towards the long-term targets as proposed in this \\npaper. The findings from this paper confirm that focusing \\non impactful lifestyle changes in terms of carbon footprint \\nreduction potential is crucial, as pointed out by a previous \\nreview study (Wynes and Nicholas 2017). Despite the large \\nmitigation impacts expected from lifestyle changes, consumer \\nlifestyles are deeply embedded in complex cultural contexts, \\nsocial practices and provisioning systems. To address the \\nmagnitude of required changes, a transformation of lifestyles \\nmay need to employ mutually enhancing dual approaches, \\nthrough voluntary efforts and movements by citizens and \\nfacilitation through policies and stakeholder actions to sup-\\nport decarbonized options while discouraging unsustainable \\nones. This multi-stakeholder view can be facilitated through \\nthe research opportunities discussed in this paper.\\nImplementing the research opportunities discussed in this \\npaper may require a highly interdisciplinary approach, includ-\\ning but not limited to engineering, sociology, behavior sci-\\nences, economics, and policy sciences. Such research efforts \\ncan contribute to a transdisciplinary approach to advance \\nsustainability science and address its various complexities, \\nwhich include human behavior, norms and culture, and socio-\\necological systems (Shrivastava et\\xa0al. 2020). The approach \\nsuggested in this paper can be used to advance both academic \\nand practical knowledge on how to facilitate the transition of \\nlifestyles necessary to meet the 1.5\\xa0°C climate goal.\\nAcknowledgements This research was partially supported by the Finn-\\nish Innovation Fund Sitra, the KR Foundation, the United Nations’10-\\nYear Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and \\nProduction (10YFP), and the Environment Research and Technology \\nDevelopment Fund (JPMEERF16S11600) of the Environmental Resto-\\nration and Conservation Agency, Japan.

Though the greenhouse effect is heavily driven by water vapor, human emissions of water vapor are not a significant contributor to warming.\\nAlthough CFCs are greenhouse gases, they are regulated by the Montreal Protocol which was motivated by CFCs' contribution to ozone depletion rather than by their contribution to global warming. Ozone depletion has only a minor role in greenhouse warming, though the two processes are sometimes confused in the media. In 2016, negotiators from over 170 nations meeting at the summit of the United Nations Environment Programme reached a legally binding accord to phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. The use of CFC-12 (except some essential uses) has been phased out due to its ozone depleting properties.

This will involve trying to train different machine learning models, to see how precisely these patterns can be used to predict how much carbon is emitted based on the correlating factors.\\nWe will try to answer the following questions: \\n\\n- Which are the most decisive factors for carbon emissions for an individual?\\n- Does internet usage directly affect total carbon emissions?\\n- Does the important factors differ between males and females?\\n- Does people who see themselves as \"energy efficient\" generally have lower total carbon emissions?\\n- Are the people travelling frequently by plane, the ones who are emitting the most carbon?\\n- Which machine learning methods did you choose to apply in the application?\\n- How accurate is your solution of prediction?\\n- Which were the challenges in the project development?\\n\\n# Data Preparation\\n\\n### Data Collection / loading:\\n\\n### Data cleaning and exploration\\n\\nIt looks like it follows a kind of skewed normal distribution, with a few outliers lying greatly above the mean\\n\\nThe biggest correlation with carbon emissions, seem to be the monthly travelled distance by personal vehicle. Other factor with clear correlations seem to be type of transport, vehicle type and frequency of travelling with airplane. There also seem to be a smaller correlation with the amount of clothes people buy.\\n\\nDoes internet usage have an impact on carbon emissions?\\n\\nThere is a slight correlation, but nowhere near enough to asser any tendencies. We are lucky computer people!\\n\\nLet\\'s see if theres as difference between male an female patterns\\n\\nThere doesn\\'t really seem to be a difference of how much the factors weigh between males and females\\n\\n### Outliers\\n\\nAs we can see, the distribution of distance travelled by vehicle is very skewed, with 75% of the data lying beneath 3000 km pr month, with quite a few outlier being outragerously above the median. This might still be an accurate representation though, since some individuals just might travel that much. \\nWe\\'ll keep it for the variance\\n\\nLet\\'s see if people are as accurate as they think, when they say they\\'re energy efficient!\\n\\nWe can see that people say that the are energy efficient generally tend to have a little bit lower carbon emission in total, but the difference really is only about 1,5% lower than the \\'No\\' category.\\n\\nThe total sum of carbon emissions seems to be higher by people declaring that they\\'re being energy efficient, indicating that a lot more people think they are being efficient than not, while not really making any difference in the emitted carbon dioxide!\\n\\n### Plane travel\\n\\nWe can see theres a small correlation between the Frequency of air travel, and their carbon emission, let\\'s sxplore what it means\\n\\nAs we can see, the distribution of people is fairly equal between all different categories of flight frequency, but there\\'s a clearly tendency of higher average carbon emissions from people who are in the \\'very frequent\\' category.\\n\\nThe mean carbon emssions are around 22% higher for people who travel very frequently by air.\\n\\n\\n## Supervised Machine learning\\n\\nLet\\'s try and see if we can predict total carbon emission values by training different classifier models.\\nSince we\\'re doing classification, we\\'ll bin the carbon emission numbers into categories\\n\\n### Model training\\n\\nThe XGBoost model looks to have the best accuracy, with a score of 0.9747 on the test set, with only a MAE of 123.98. This is more then likely beacuse of the model ability to be regularization, both L1 and L2 to handle overfitting. Not only that, but  also how its build on top of gradient boosting framework, tree pruning, handling missing values, cross-validation and parallel processing.\\n\\n#### Naive Bayes model\\n\\nAn accuracy of about 70 percent, not bad for a first try, but I think we can do better.\\nLet\\'s try to focus on the correlating values\\n\\n#### Validation\\n\\nIn the end, it made a bigger difference to adjust the test set size to around 15% of the set\\n\\n### Decision Tree Classifier\\n\\n#### Validation\\n\\nEven better than before. Maybe our predictions can be even more accurate by using several decision trees\\n\\n### Random Forest Classifier\\n\\n#### Validation\\n\\n### Classification summary\\n\\n**Iteration 1**\\n- No data normalization\\n- 5 equally divided bins <br />\\n\\n80% accuracy (RFC)\\n\\nAt 80% accuracy the random forest classifier seems to be the most accurate model we have tested. It seems to correctly categorize a lot of the lower emitting categories, and is a little less accurate on cases with fewer instances. It\\'s still making some big mistakes which might not show up in the overall calculated score, but is very significant.\\nFor example, none of the models have succesfully caught any people in the topmost carbon emitting category. Perhaps implying, that the category data sould be binned differently, becuase if only very few instances fit into the bin, the model might not have any chance of recieving enough training data to be able to recognize the extreme cases.\\n\\n**Iteration 2**\\n- Data transformed to normal distribution\\n- 4 equally divided bins\\n\\n87% accuracy (RFC).\\n\\nModel accuracy have improved in accuracy. I accredit this to the fewer bins and the now normal distribution of the data. Even though the accuracy seems higher, the result is still unsatisfactory since it fails to identify any extreme cases in both high and low end. Because of the normal distribution transform, the data have accumulated around the mean, resulting in only around 2% of the data fitting in the extreme bins. The training data might still be to sparse to let the model identify these few extreme cases\\n\\n**Iteration 3**\\n- Data transformed to normal distribution\\n- 3 equally divided bins\\n\\n92% accuracy (RFC)\\n\\nModel have once model improved in accuracy.

At the beginning, we chose to start with only one hidden layer and 32 neurons, and then each time increase neurons with the power of 2. We made the assumption that the max number of neurons in a layer should be 512 to avoid overfitting, beacuse we know that more neurons means that the model has a higher capacity to learn form the traning data; however we dont want the model to learn from noise and other irrelevant factors, which can lead to overfitting.\\n\\n#### Configuration\\n\\nThe 4 performance metrics of the neural network with varying configurations over 50 epochs of layers and neurons are shown in the table above. This config are defined by the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer. For all iterations, we chose the activations function: ReLU:\\n```math\\nf(x) = max(0, x)\\n```\\n\\n#### Results\\n\\nThe results show that the accuracy of the model increases with the number of layers and neurons. We can see that the accuracy of the model is 0.9819 with 4 layers (256, 512, 512, 512 neurons) The test loss is 109.2275 and the mean absolute error is 75.5905. This is the best result we have achieved with the neural network.\\nWe can also conclude that the neural network has better results the our XGBoost model, that \\'only\\' got an accuracy of 0.9747 and a MAE of 123.9864.\\n\\n\\n#### Alterantive improvements\\n\\nWithout a doubt, we know that our neural network has a good accuracy 0.9819 and a littel MAE on 75.5905. However, we can still alot of different was to try and improve the model.\\nThe different tings that can be experimaneted with are the following:\\n- The number of epochs\\n- The number of layers\\n- The number of neurons in each layer\\n- The activation function\\n\\n## Unsupervised machine learning\\n\\n### Applying the data to K-means, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN & Mean Shift\\n\\nThe perpose of applying these clustering models, is to see if, there are patterns in the data, that we haven\\'t been able to see ny the numbers only.\\n\\n### Hierarchical clustering\\n\\n### K-means\\n\\n#### Multible cluster model testing\\n\\n#### Clustering summary:\\n\\nWe have try using K-means, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN & Mean shift to see if there are any patterns in the data, but it seems that there are no clear patterns in the data, when applying these clustering methods to the hole dataset. We have tried with and without scaling the data. Additionally, we have tried to use different numbers of clusters, but the results are still the same. \\nThis is concluded based on the visualisation of the clusters from the different methods due to the visualistations being porly; However, the silhouette score have actually been quite high, which indicates that there are some patterns in the data.\\n\\nSilhouette score (without scaling and pca):\\n* K-means: 0.727 (with 2 clusters), 0.624 (with 3 clusters)\\n* Hierarchical clustering: 0.426\\n* Mean shift: 0.727\\n* DBSCAN: indicates one clusters in the data\\n\\nSilhouette score (without scaling and pca):\\n* K-means: 0.549 (2 clusters), 0.426 (3 clusters)\\n* Hierarchical clustering: 0.542 (2 clusters)\\n\\nWe have also tried using only some parts of the datas features, these results are gives som visualisation endication of patterns.\\nThe features used for the clustering are: \\'Monthly Grocery Bill\\', \\'Waste Bag Weekly Count\\', \\'How Long TV PC Daily Hour\\', \\'How Many New Clothes Monthly\\', \\'How Long Internet Daily Hour\\'\\n\\nSilhouette score (without scaling and pca):\\n* K-means: 0.79 (with 2 clusters), 0.727 (with 3 clusters)\\n* Hierarchical clustering: 0.698\\n* Mean shift: 0.597\\n* DBSCAN: indicates one clusters in the data\\n\\nOther features combinations have also been tried, but the results gives similar visualisation and silhouette score.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTheres much interesing information in exploring this dataset, and we can definetely find a lot of patterns that is crucial for identifying which personal lifestyle factors are significant when it comes to calculationg our total carbon emission output.\\n\\n**Here is our discoveries summarized:**\\n\\n- The most significant factors for an individuals carbon emission seem to be their choice of transport. People that drive many kilometers monthly in personal vehicles are also the one who have a tendency to have the highest carbon emissions.\\n\\n- Theres a small indication that internet usage has an impact on carbon emissions to correlating factors, but no direct pattern can be concluded, so we deem it as insignificant\\n\\n- There seem to be very little difference in the correlating factors between males and females\\n\\n- People who see themselves as \\'Energy efficient\\' only seem the emit about 1,5% less carbon than people who say they\\'re \\'Not energy efficient\\', which we conclude makes it insignificant\\n\\n- People who travel with airplanes very frequently seem to emit around 22% more carbon on average, than people who never fly\\n\\nWe tried to use different classification machine learning methods to try and predict carbon output based on correlating factors, and clustering methods for trying to discov hidden patterns in the data.\\n\\nFor classification we tried:\\n\\n- Naive Bayes classifier\\n- Decision Tree classifier\\n- Random Forest classifier\\n\\nWe tried several iterations for optimizing the models by adjusting the category amount and the normalisation of the input data. In the end, the RFC model was the most succesful, with an accuracy of aaround 92% with 3 categories. However, we deem the result as unsaticfactory, since the input data still is a bit unsuited for this kind of machine learning, with 92% of the data fitting into a single category. The good accuracy is due to overfitting.\\nOn the last iteration we tried to divide the categories by quantiles, which made the model drop to 67% accuracy, but is a way more useful and less overfitted model.\\n\\nFor clustering we tried: \\n- K-means\\n- Hierarchical clustering\\n- DBSCAN \\n- Mean shift. \\n\\nThese clustering models revealed no significant patters in the data, with the DBSCAN resulting in an optimal cluster amount of 1. Higest silhouette score was 0.79 for K-means with 2 clusters; however the visulaization of the clusters from the different models were poor, didnt give any further insight to the data in the form of given patterns. Only way to get better visualizations, was to use specific features and not the hole dataset. This was without a doubt one of the challenges in the project development.\\n\\n'),\n",

This central message is \\nechoed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s Special Report on the impacts of global warming \\nof 1.5-degrees (IPCC 2018), as well as the conclusion of the \\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions \\nGap Report 2020 which devotes a chapter to low-carbon \\nlifestyles (UNEP 2020). Further, the upcoming IPCC sixth \\nassessment report is expected to highlight demand and social \\naspects of mitigation (Creutzig et\\xa0al. 2018). At the country \\nlevel, national and regional governments now also incor -\\nporate lifestyle and behavior changes into their long-term \\nstrategies, in parallel with technological changes. Transfor -\\nmation to a net-zero economy is “not just about technologies \\n(…but) about people and their\\xa0daily lives” and “lifestyle \\nchoices can make a real difference, while improving quality \\nof life” (European Commission 2018) and “shifting the way \\nof life (…) provides a major impact directly and indirectly \\non climate change” (Government of Japan 2019).\\nIn terms of research on lifestyle changes and climate \\nchange mitigation, the body of literature has grown but is \\nstill limited. For example, emission pathways based on the \\nintegrated assessment models (IAMs) incorporate various \\naspects of lifestyle changes; however, these need to be devel -\\noped to more comprehensively explore the impacts of indi-\\nrect emissions through the lifecycle of goods and services \\n(van den Berg et\\xa0al. 2019; Saujot et\\xa0al. 2021).

GHG \\nemissions resulting from household consumption comprise \\n58–72% of total global emissions (Ivanova et\\xa0al. 2016; Her -\\ntwich and Peters 2009). These carbon footprints consist of \\nboth direct emissions, such as the use of fossil fuels at home \\nand for driving, and indirect emissions resulting from the \\nuse of goods and services by households—which can be \\neven higher than the direct ones (Hirano et\\xa0al. 2016). Recent \\ndevelopments in this field include attempts to quantify miti-\\ngation impacts from a variety of demand-side options related \\nto food, housing, and mobility (Jones and Kammen 2011; \\nSchanes et\\xa0al. 2016; Bjelle et\\xa0al. 2018; Wood et\\xa0al. 2018; \\nIvanova et\\xa0al. 2020; Moran et\\xa0al. 2020). Despite the ris-\\ning number of such studies, however, most focus only on \\nthe potentials based on individual demand-side options and \\noffer no concrete scenarios in the form of the aggregated \\nimpacts from lifestyle changes required to close the gaps \\nbetween currently prevalent heavy carbon footprints and the \\nclimate targets. Building on these existing approaches, the \\npresent study proposes a consumption-based target for life-\\nstyle carbon footprints and also explores the extents needed \\nto change lifestyles to meet the 1.5\\xa0°C climate target of the \\nParis Agreement.\\nThis paper proposes an approach for assessing lifestyle \\ncarbon footprints and lifestyle changes aimed at limiting \\nglobal warming to 1.5\\xa0°C and facilitating the transition to \\ndecarbonized lifestyles through participatory research. After \\nintroducing per-capita targets of lifestyle carbon footprints, it \\nprovides a hotspot analysis of current lifestyles and mitiga-\\ntion impacts from individual and multiple lifestyle change \\noptions, focusing on the case studies of Finland and Japan. \\nThe quantitative results discussed are based on the key find-\\nings from phase I of the “1.5-Degree Lifestyles” project, an \\ninternational research project on decarbonizing lifestyles, \\nand its technical report (IGES et\\xa0al. 2019). Building up to \\nthe quantitative analysis, it discusses research opportuni-\\nties including subnational analysis, living lab, and scenario \\nanalysis that could be followed up on to facilitate lifestyle \\nchanges that can be taken aimed at decarbonization.\\nConsumption‑based per‑capita targets \\ncorresponding to\\xa0the\\xa01.5\\xa0°C climate goal\\nThis section explains the different types of targets and their \\nrelevance. Typically, climate change targets have been \\ndiscussed in terms of territorial emissions such as at the \\ncountry level (Climate Analytics and NewClimate Institute \\n2020), but such accounting cannot comprehensively cap-\\nture the impacts of consumption activities through indirect emissions in supply chains occurring outside of the terri-\\ntory being studied. On the other hand, consumption-based \\ncarbon footprint accounting is useful for devising policies \\nthat avoid leakage of emissions beyond territorial bor -\\nders—an approach empowering governments, companies, \\nand consumers to shape low-carbon actions at the global, \\ncountry, city, and household levels (Peters 2010).\\nFurther, most existing targets are proposed at the \\naggregated level, such as global and country totals, but \\nin the context of promoting lifestyle changes, aggregated \\nterritorial-based targets may not be explicitly relevant to \\nhouseholds and local stakeholders, since such targets are \\nnot directly linked to people’s daily lifestyles or fail to \\naccount for the indirect emissions resulting from consump-\\ntion. Therefore, consumption-based per-capita targets can \\nfacilitate actions to decarbonize people’s lifestyles, and \\ncan also reveal the gaps between predominant lifestyles \\nand levels of decarbonization required to meet the targets.\\nIn this study, we define “lifestyle carbon footprints” as \\nthe sum of direct and indirect GHG emissions induced \\nfrom household consumption, excluding government \\nexpenditure and capital investment. In relation to the \\nplanetary boundaries (Rockstrom 2009; Steffen et\\xa0al. \\n2015), few studies have attempted to downscale climate \\nchange boundaries into per-capita targets (Nykvist et\\xa0al. \\n2013; Dao et\\xa0al. 2015). Further, these targets are static and \\nfail to account for the gradual reduction in carbon emis-\\nsions anticipated to take place by the second half of the \\ntwenty-first century, as suggested by the major mitigation \\npathways aligned with the climate goals (UNEP 2020). \\nFor these reasons, the present study established consump-\\ntion-based per-capita targets of lifestyle carbon footprints \\nassuming the gradual decrease of carbon budgets to the \\nsecond half of the century.\\nThe per-capita lifestyle carbon footprint targets proposed \\nbelow are based on a review of existing emission pathways, \\nprojections of global population (United Nations 2017), \\nand share of carbon footprints of household consumption \\nin total footprints (Hertwich and Peters 2009). As shown in \\nFig.\\xa01, using the identified representative pathways towards \\nthe 1.5\\xa0°C Paris Agreement goal, and considering either \\nlimited or intensive use of negative emission technologies \\n(van Vuuren et\\xa0al. 2018;\\xa0Ranger et\\xa0al. 2012;\\xa0Rockström et\\xa0al. \\n2017 ), the upper and lower annual targets of per-capita life -\\nstyle carbon footprints are: 2.5–3.2  tCO2e in 2030, 1.4–2.2 \\n tCO2e in 2040, and 0.7–1.4  tCO2e in 2050. It should be \\nnoted that, to explicitly focus on the parts related to lifestyles \\nof citizens, these targets do not include footprints result -\\ning from government expenditure and capital investment. \\nHowever, accounting for such factors in allocating footprints \\ncould be taken up in future research, as they are not only \\nfactors related to satisfying the needs of a country’s citizens \\nbut also those of future generations, as well as its exports.', metadata={'source': '../data/research_paper.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

In terms of the carbon budget, the latter is \\nclose to a 2\\xa0°C target with extensive use of negative emission \\ntechnologies.\\nAssessing hotspots of\\xa0lifestyle carbon \\nfootprints and\\xa0comparing them with\\xa0targets\\nHere, we explain the approach for assessing lifestyle car -\\nbon footprints, present the results of estimations, the gaps \\nbetween current lifestyle carbon footprints and the targets, \\nand the hotspot areas of lifestyle carbon footprints.\\nAssessing lifestyle carbon footprints through considera -\\ntion of different consumption domains and components \\ncan help to identify underlying problems and potential \\nsolutions. There are two basic approaches for estimating \\ncarbon footprints. One, used in most existing studies on \\ncarbon footprints related to household consumption, is \\nmonetary-based estimation (Hertwich 2005; Tukker et\\xa0al. \\n2010; Ivanova et\\xa0al. 2016). The other focuses on lifestyles \\nbased on physical amounts of consumption, for which \\nlimited studies exist (Barrett et\\xa0al. 2002; Nissinen et\\xa0al. \\n2007; Girod et\\xa0al. 2010; Moore et\\xa0al. 2013; Lettenmeier \\n2018). In our study, we mainly used estimation based on \\nphysical amounts of consumption, since it can more accu-\\nrately model substitutions between different consumption items—such as transportation modes, energy sources, and \\nfood ingredients. This approach also facilitates a better \\nunderstanding of the consumption patterns of citizens, \\nsince it examines carbon footprint hotspots on the basis of \\nboth physical consumption amounts and carbon intensities.\\nUsing the physical-amount approach, we examined car -\\nbon footprints and characteristics of consumer lifestyles \\nfocusing on food, mobility, and housing, and examined the \\namounts quantified based on actual physical amounts of \\nconsumption. The quantities estimated were based on fig-\\nures for mobility distance in passenger-km, food consump-\\ntion in kg, and energy consumption in kWh. For the other \\ndomains such as leisure, consumer goods, and services we \\nused monetary-based estimation, to ensure we had a fuller \\npicture, or overview of household consumption.\\nWe estimated carbon footprints of average consumers in \\nfive target countries, including Finland and Japan, for nutri-\\ntion, housing, and mobility domains based on the collected \\nnational and other official statistics, such as nutrition intake \\nand food supply, transport and fuel consumption, housing \\nand water supply, and energy statistics. To estimate carbon \\nfootprints for each product and service, we used carbon \\nintensity data obtained from life cycle inventory databases, \\nwhich are widely used and provide extensive coverage of \\nitems, such as Ecoinvent (Wernet et\\xa0al. 2016), as well as \\nadditional data on carbon footprints in other domains from \\ninput–output models such as ENVIMAT (Seppälä et\\xa0al. \\n2009) and GLIO (Nansai et\\xa0al. 2012). These carbon foot-\\nprints and physical consumption amounts were aggregated \\ninto several components per domain to enable comparison \\nbetween the target countries and quantification of the impacts \\nfrom lifestyle changes. More details on the data sources are \\navailable in the technical report (IGES et\\xa0al. 2019).\\nAssessing lifestyle carbon footprints and\\xa0gaps \\nwith\\xa0the\\xa0targets\\nResults of the analysis revealed significant gaps between \\ncurrent lifestyle carbon footprints and the 2030–2050 tar -\\ngets. Figure\\xa0 2 shows the estimated lifestyle carbon footprints \\nof average consumers in five countries, encompassing all \\naspects of household consumption—nutrition, housing, \\nmobility, consumer goods, leisure, and services—in com-\\nparison with the lower and upper targets. The results clearly \\npoint to the need for drastic and rapid reductions in lifestyle \\ncarbon footprints of 60–80% by 2030 and 80–90% by 2050 \\nin developed countries (Finland and Japan) and up to 40% \\nin 2030 and at least 20% to over 80% in 2050 in developing \\ncountries (China, Brazil, and India).Fig. 1  Lower and upper targets of per-capita lifestyle carbon foot-\\nprints in relation to meeting the 1.5\\xa0°C climate goal.

The estimated lifestyle carbon foot-\\nprints and physical consumption patterns were visualized \\nas skyline charts to examine the hotspots, and comparisons \\nwere made with the per-capita targets introduced in the \\nprevious section (Fig.\\xa0 3). For each colored block (rectan-\\ngle) in the figure, its area represents the carbon footprint \\nof the item, the width refers to consumption amount, and \\nthe height shows carbon intensity. The figure also shows \\ncurrent and indicative target carbon footprints, with dot-\\nted lines showing average intensities across components. \\nHere, the allocation of target carbon footprints between \\ncarbon intensity and consumption amounts as well as \\nbetween domains is only indicative, as different forms of \\nallocations are possible. Nevertheless, even an indicative \\ntarget can provide useful insights on the extent and cover -\\nage of the changes required to meet the related target.\\nThese visualizations enable an intuitive understanding \\nof the hotspots of lifestyle carbon footprints based on phys-\\nical consumption, either due to large carbon footprint (size \\nof the area) or high-carbon intensity (large height)—for \\nexample, consumption of meat, energy from fossil fuels, \\ncar-driving, and flights. Moreover, comparison with tar -\\ngets in each domain can deepen our understanding of the \\nlevels and types of changes in lifestyles and provisioning \\nsystems that will be required. To illustrate, in the mobil-\\nity domain, rapid reduction of both transport distance and \\nintensity may be needed to comply with the 1.5\\xa0°C target \\n(comparing the size of black, pink, and light blue dotted \\nline boxes).

To do this, we first \\nidentified the lifestyle change options that would have the \\nmost impact by literature review, then quantified around \\n30 options per country. Calculations were made based on \\nthe three approaches proposed above and the lifestyle car -\\nbon footprint and physical amounts of consumption esti-\\nmated in this study. Absolute reduction can be modeled \\nby reducing physical consumption amounts, and efficiency \\nimprovements can be reflected by reducing carbon intensi-\\nties in the dataset. Modal shifts can be quantified by shift-\\ning amounts of consumption of particular items to another \\nitem, as each has a different carbon intensity.\\nWe focused on quantifying the maximum potential of \\nfootprint reduction assuming full adoption (100% adop-\\ntion rate) of an option—for example, commuting without \\nany car or always eating vegetarian meals—but also show \\nresults for partial adoption of options. This is because in \\nthe real world, households are more likely to only make \\npartial use of commuting by bicycle or vegetarian meals, \\nor only a part of the population might adopt these options. \\nFigures for partial adoption were calculated by multiplying \\nfull implementation impacts by the adoption rate.\\nFigure\\xa0 4 shows the lifestyle change options identified. \\nThe most effective options include private travel with-\\nout a car, shifting to renewable electricity, electric cars, \\nvegetarian diets, and vehicle efficiency improvement \\n(potential of each option if fully implemented: 500\\xa0kg to \\nover 1500\\xa0kg  CO2e per capita on average). Other effective \\noptions include ridesharing, living close to the workplace, \\ntemperature control using heat pumps, commuting with-\\nout a car, use of dairy product alternatives, low-carbon \\nproteins, and living in smaller spaces (250–500\\xa0kg  CO2e \\nper capita).\\nThese results also highlight the importance of cover -\\ning all three approaches discussed in this paper: absolute \\nreduction, modal shift, and efficiency improvements. For \\nexample, many of the most impactful options with mitiga-\\ntion potentials over 500\\xa0kg  CO2e per-capita adopt the modal \\nshift approach, such as shifting from cars to public transport, \\nfrom conventional to renewable energy, from gasoline to \\nelectric cars, and from meat-rich to vegetarian diets, but also \\non the efficiency improvement approach, such as using effi-\\ncient vehicles and ride sharing. Absolute reduction options \\nare also prominent among the effective options identified, \\nsuch as reducing mobility distance, living space, and hot \\nwater consumption.\\nAs illustrated in the figure, the mitigation potentials differ \\namong the case countries. This implies that the effective -\\nness of lifestyle change options depends on each context, such as differences due to actual physical consumption pat-\\nterns, e.g., car driving, meat and dairy product consumption, \\nenergy consumption, and grid electricity mix. There are also \\nbackground reasons, such as different structures in provision, \\ninfrastructure, and habits of consumers. Therefore, options \\nsuch as car-free travel and dietary shift have larger mitiga-\\ntion potentials in Finland, whereas other options such as \\nrenewable electricity are more effective in Japan.\\nAggregated mitigation impacts from\\xa0lifestyle \\nchanges\\nTo better understand the level and types of demand-side \\nactions needed to meet the 1.5\\xa0°C climate goal, we investi-\\ngated lifestyle changes beyond the individual option of life-\\nstyle changes, through quantifying the aggregate mitigation \\npotentials from multiple options covering all the consump-\\ntion domains of food, housing, mobility, goods, leisure, and \\nservices. Adding up the impacts from more than one lifestyle \\nchange option does not produce accurate aggregate figures \\ndue to areas of synergy and overlap. Therefore, aggregated \\nimpacts from multiple lifestyle change options were quanti -\\nfied by considering the overlaps and synergies. As an initial \\nattempt to examine the level of required changes, we made \\na basic assumption that all selected options were adopted \\nat the same rate. The analysis results (Fig.\\xa0 5) revealed that \\n65–75% adoption of approximately 30 quantified options in \\ncombination with 65–75% reduction of footprints in goods, \\nleisure, and services by 2030 would be needed for both \\ncountries to comply with the upper to lower targets of 2030 \\n(2.5–3.2  tCO2e).\\nThis means that ambitious adaption of lifestyle change \\noptions can contribute to reducing lifestyle carbon foot-\\nprints towards the targets of the Paris Agreement. However, \\nthe level and coverage of required changes is both high \\nand broad due to the proximity of year 2030. In view of \\nthe 2050 targets, the analysis also concludes that even full \\nimplementation of these options with 90% reduction of \\nfootprints in goods, leisure, and services is not sufficient \\nto meet the 2050 lower target (0.7  tCO2e). This implies \\nthat much broader-ranging lifestyle change options and sys-\\ntemic changes, including large-scale behavioral changes \\ncombined with huge innovations in provisioning systems \\nmay be needed to comply with the 1.5\\xa0°C climate goal. \\nThese findings on aggregated mitigation impacts from the \\ncombination of multiple lifestyle change options under -\\nscore the need for ambitious uptake of currently available \\noptions and additional new decarbonization options, as \\nwell as structural changes in consumption habits and pro-\\nvisioning systems.', metadata={'source': '../data/research_paper.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

The quantitative analysis proposed above repre-\\nsents only an initial step, and further research is needed in \\nthis field. Recognizing that there are gaps between decar -\\nbonization targets and current lifestyle carbon footprints, \\nthere is a need for exploring how to fill them, through \\nincorporating lifestyle changes. The analysis of lifestyle \\ncarbon footprints in this paper identified means to reduce \\nGHG emissions derived from consumer lifestyles—abso -\\nlute reduction, modal shift, and efficiency improvement. \\nIn terms of implementation, the area to be focused on \\ngoing forwards is how to capitalize on these means to \\nsupport citizens, communities, governments, businesses, \\nand other stakeholders in transforming lifestyles and con-\\ntexts of living. This can be approached from three per -\\nspectives: clarifying the impacts from lifestyle changes \\nand the gaps with the target, envisioning possible future \\nbased on consumption-based scenarios and roadmaps, and \\nfacilitating lifestyle changes in real-life settings. To date, \\nfrom the footprint perspective, only a few existing stud-\\nies adopt the participatory approach, through stakeholder \\nworkshops (Leppänen et\\xa0al. 2012; Vita et\\xa0al. 2019). This \\nsection extends the footprint-based quantitative analysis to \\nincorporate these perspectives through subnational analysis \\non carbon footprints and lifestyle changes, integration with \\nliving lab approaches, and consumption-based scenario \\ndevelopment.\\nSubnational analysis of\\xa0lifestyle carbon footprints \\nand\\xa0lifestyle changes\\nOne opportunity as an area of study is analysis of lifestyle \\ncarbon footprints and lifestyle changes at the subnational \\nlevel. The availability of data related to household con-\\nsumption is growing—not only in the conventional format \\nof aggregated statistics of household consumptions at both country- and city-level but also covering different aspects \\nof household consumption, including survey microdata of \\nindividual responses to surveys. As illustrated in this paper, \\nquantifying mitigation potentials from lifestyle changes \\nhelp to understand the effectiveness and potential contribu-\\ntions of lifestyle changes to the climate goals. However, to \\ndate, most studies on the quantification of carbon footprint \\nreduction focus on countries or regions (Jones and Kam-\\nmen 2011; Schanes et\\xa0al. 2016; Bjelle et\\xa0al. 2018; Wood \\net\\xa0al. 2018; Ivanova et\\xa0al. 2020; Moran et\\xa0al. 2020), with \\nonly a few exceptions (Hersey et\\xa0al. 2009; Dubois et\\xa0al. \\n2019). Considering the pivotal roles of cities in activating \\nsustainable lifestyles and decarbonized societies (Peters \\n2010; Wright et\\xa0al. 2011; Bailey et\\xa0al. 2019), the assess-\\nment of lifestyle carbon footprints proposed in this paper \\ncould be extended to subnational units such as cities and \\nlocal communities.\\nA similar analysis can also be extended to quantify miti-\\ngation potentials from lifestyle changes in different con-\\nsumer segments using survey microdata. Previous research \\nbased on survey microdata covering carbon footprints of \\nhouseholds or consumer segments has revealed that they \\nvary widely, even within-country, by from 3 to 10 times \\n(Weber and Matthews 2008; Froemelt et\\xa0al. 2018; Koide \\net\\xa0al. 2019). This analysis approach is especially relevant \\nconsidering the growing awareness of the inequalities, in \\nterms of carbon footprints, between consumer and income \\nsegments globally and within each country, which under -\\nscores the urgency of addressing the emissions and foot-\\nprints of high-carbon population segments (Kartha et\\xa0al. \\n2020; Ivanova and Wood 2020; UNEP 2020). The segmen-\\ntation method in existing studies can be combined with the \\napproach proposed in this paper to investigate the impacts \\nof a transition in lifestyles of different consumer segments. \\nSuch analysis can identify mitigation potentials in terms \\nof high-carbon activities and high-carbon population seg-\\nments, which are both useful when considering the equita-\\nbility and effectiveness of mitigation actions.\\nIntegration of\\xa0lifestyle carbon footprint analysis \\nwith\\xa0living lab approaches\\nThere is a need to examine the feasibility of lifestyle \\nchanges, levels of potential acceptance by citizens, and \\nnecessary supporting measures and policy actions, as well \\nas assess the impacts from a carbon footprint perspective. \\nA deeper and more realistic understanding of lifestyle \\nchanges can be obtained from the living labs approach. \\n‘Living labs’ refers to an open innovation platform with \\nreal-life environments to address societal challenges \\nthrough the collaboration of various stakeholders (Hos-\\nsain et\\xa0al. 2019 ).

Living labs may contribute to generating \\nuseful applied knowledge and inspiring rapid transforma-\\ntions in society and technology, creating not only direct \\nimpacts at the niche level but also indirect impacts through \\nadjustment of policies and provision structures, as well as \\ndiffuse impacts on cultural and normative values of socie-\\nties (Schliwa et\\xa0al. 2015).\\nThe living labs approach has numerous applications in \\nlow-carbon urban development (Voytenko et\\xa0al. 2016) and \\ndaily practices related to domains of lifestyles such as food, \\nenergy, building, work, and product use (von Geibler et\\xa0al. \\n2014; Davies and Doyle 2015; Devaney and Davies 2017; Kivimaa et\\xa0al. 2017; Jensen et\\xa0al. 2018).

These experimentations with \\nreal-life settings can be combined with the methodology \\nproposed in this paper to better comprehend the practicality \\nas well as necessity of certain actions, to facilitate impact-\\nful lifestyle changes.\\nDeveloping consumption‑based mitigation \\nscenarios and\\xa0roadmaps incorporating lifestyle \\nchanges\\nAs this paper shows, examining aggregated impacts by com -\\nbining multiple lifestyle change options helps us understand \\nthe lifestyle changes that are needed to meet the climate \\ngoals. Desirable outcomes in the future can be approached \\nthrough development of future scenarios and roadmaps \\nincorporating carbon footprints and lifestyle changes. Aim-\\ning towards decarbonized lifestyles, such efforts could \\nincorporate three elements: (1) consumption-based carbon \\nfootprints and mitigation potentials from lifestyle changes \\nexplicitly linked to the decarbonization target, (2) partici-\\npatory process involving citizens and stakeholders, and (3) \\nroadmaps with supporting measures through policy and \\nstakeholder actions, as explained below.\\nFirst, scenario analysis can be based on consumption-\\nbased carbon footprints and explicitly indicate pathways to \\nthe decarbonization target. To date, a number of low-carbon \\nscenarios based on direct emissions incorporating the back -\\ncasting approach have been proposed (Hughes and Strachan \\n2010). However, these scenarios cannot fully account for \\nthe indirect impacts from consumption activities related to \\nlifestyles, due to the relatively large indirect emissions. Con-\\nversely, from a consumption-based perspective, some studies \\nquantified impacts from multiple demand-side options (Vita \\net\\xa0al. 2019; Moran et\\xa0al. 2020), but these studies do not focus \\non the gap with the decarbonization targets. Only a limited \\nnumber of scenarios of future lifestyles have been developed \\nthat comprehensively consider life cycle impacts and the \\ngaps with the target levels (Girod et\\xa0al. 2014; Lettenmeier \\net\\xa0al. 2014; Impiö et\\xa0al. 2020). These methods can be fur -\\nther expanded to incorporate consumption-based per-capita \\ntargets and the methodology of modeling lifestyle changes \\nproposed in this paper.\\nSecond, future scenarios linked with lifestyle carbon foot-\\nprints can be developed through stakeholder engagement \\nprocesses such as with citizens, the business sector, com-\\nmunity organizations, and policymakers. As the forms sus-\\ntainable lifestyles will take depend on the contexts (Akenji \\nand Chen 2016), so too will future decarbonized lifestyles. \\nStakeholder engagement can facilitate actions in policy \\nand business sectors by comprehensively considering the \\nimplications for lifestyles of citizens and environmental, \\neconomic, and social consequences. The scenario making process can be used as a tool for communicating with non-\\nscientific audiences and engaging stakeholders (Raskin \\net\\xa0al. 2004). Studies developing future lifestyle scenarios \\nwith stakeholder engagement (Leppänen et\\xa0al. 2012; Vita \\net\\xa0al. 2019) can be extended to explicitly link consumption-\\nbased footprint targets to investigate the desired types of \\ntransitions. Making use of such participatory processes can \\nensure the views of citizens and stakeholders are reflected \\nin the desired actions, to achieve a high quality of life within \\nclimate boundaries.\\nFinally, the extent and level of ambition of lifestyle \\nchanges required to meet the target necessitate supporting \\nmeasures and stakeholder actions. Unsustainable patterns of \\nconsumption are deeply embedded in contexts linked with \\neveryday routines and practices (Evans and Jackson\\xa0 2007; \\nSalomaa and Juhola 2020). Systems of provisioning linked \\nwith social practices have crucial roles beyond behaviors \\nof citizens (Spaargaren and Oosterveer 2009). Therefore, \\ninstead of placing overall responsibility entirely in the hands \\nof each consumer, a transition to decarbonized lifestyles may \\ninstead require systemic actions through all stakeholder \\nactions. This calls for supporting measures through new \\nsystems of provisioning as well as policies to enable decar -\\nbonized lifestyles, which can be identified and supported \\nthrough developing roadmaps alongside the scenarios.\\nScenarios are often combined with roadmapping of nec-\\nessary actions along with timelines, as illustrated in low-\\ncarbon society scenarios (Kainuma et\\xa0al. 2012), sustainable \\nlifestyle scenarios (Leppänen et\\xa0al. 2012; Impiö et\\xa0al. 2020), \\nand technology roadmapping (Hussain et\\xa0al. 2017). Stake-\\nholder dialogues such as workshops can help incorporate dif-\\nferent perspectives in roadmapping, as illustrated in existing \\nstudies (Doyle and Davies 2013). Roadmaps to support and \\nenable decarbonized lifestyles can include various instru-\\nments and actions related to consumer lifestyles, including \\neconomic, regulatory, information, nudging, infrastructure, \\nand product and service provision. These actions should \\ncover and focus on the carbon footprint hotspots related to \\nnutrition, housing, mobility, consumer goods, leisure, and \\nservices identified in this paper.\\nThe research opportunities discussed above are mutually \\nlinked and may have synergies. The subnational analysis of \\nlifestyle carbon footprints can provide a useful background \\nthat informs in the areas of equitability and effectiveness of \\nactions in the scenarios. In addition, options identified as \\npart of the scenarios through the participatory process can \\nbe tested in living labs to identify supporting measures and \\nconstraints in real-life environments, and the learnings from \\nthe living labs approach can be reflected into roadmaps.', metadata={'source': '../data/research_paper.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",

Considering the magnitude of changes required, life-\\nstyles need to be decarbonized based on a transformative \\napproach with a focus on non-incremental changes embrac-\\ning higher-order, larger-scaled, deep and impactful, systemic \\nchanges towards the long-term targets as proposed in this \\npaper. The findings from this paper confirm that focusing \\non impactful lifestyle changes in terms of carbon footprint \\nreduction potential is crucial, as pointed out by a previous \\nreview study (Wynes and Nicholas 2017). Despite the large \\nmitigation impacts expected from lifestyle changes, consumer \\nlifestyles are deeply embedded in complex cultural contexts, \\nsocial practices and provisioning systems. To address the \\nmagnitude of required changes, a transformation of lifestyles \\nmay need to employ mutually enhancing dual approaches, \\nthrough voluntary efforts and movements by citizens and \\nfacilitation through policies and stakeholder actions to sup-\\nport decarbonized options while discouraging unsustainable \\nones. This multi-stakeholder view can be facilitated through \\nthe research opportunities discussed in this paper.\\nImplementing the research opportunities discussed in this \\npaper may require a highly interdisciplinary approach, includ-\\ning but not limited to engineering, sociology, behavior sci-\\nences, economics, and policy sciences. Such research efforts \\ncan contribute to a transdisciplinary approach to advance \\nsustainability science and address its various complexities, \\nwhich include human behavior, norms and culture, and socio-\\necological systems (Shrivastava et\\xa0al. 2020). The approach \\nsuggested in this paper can be used to advance both academic \\nand practical knowledge on how to facilitate the transition of \\nlifestyles necessary to meet the 1.5\\xa0°C climate goal.\\nAcknowledgements This research was partially supported by the Finn-\\nish Innovation Fund Sitra, the KR Foundation, the United Nations’10-\\nYear Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and \\nProduction (10YFP), and the Environment Research and Technology \\nDevelopment Fund (JPMEERF16S11600) of the Environmental Resto-\\nration and Conservation Agency, Japan.

       " Document(page_content=\"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities intensify the greenhouse effect. This contributes to climate change. Carbon dioxide (CO2), from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, is one of the most important factors in causing climate change. The largest emitters are China followed by the United States. The United States has higher emissions per capita. The main producers fueling the emissions globally are large oil and gas companies. Emissions from human activities have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by about 50% over pre-industrial levels. The growing levels of emissions have varied, but have been consistent among all greenhouse gases. Emissions in the 2010s averaged 56 billion tons a year, higher than any decade before. Total cumulative emissions from 1870 to 2017 were 425±20 GtC (1558 GtCO2) from fossil fuels and industry, and 180±60 GtC (660 GtCO2) from land use change. Land-use change, such as deforestation, caused about 31% of cumulative emissions over 1870–2017, coal 32%, oil 25%, and gas 10%.Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main greenhouse gas resulting from human activities. It accounts for more than half of warming. Methane (CH4) emissions have almost the same short-term impact. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and fluorinated gases (F-gases) play a lesser role in comparison.\\nElectricity generation, heat and transport are major emitters; overall energy is responsible for around 73% of emissions. Deforestation and other changes in land use also emit carbon dioxide and methane. The largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions is agriculture, closely followed by gas venting and fugitive emissions from the fossil-fuel industry. The largest agricultural methane source is livestock. Agricultural soils emit nitrous oxide partly due to fertilizers. Similarly, fluorinated gases from refrigerants play an outsized role in total human emissions.\\nThe current CO2-equivalent emission rates averaging 6.6 tonnes per person per year, are well over twice the estimated rate 2.3 tons required to stay within the 2030 Paris Agreement increase of 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over pre-industrial levels. Annual per capita emissions in the industrialized countries are typically as much as ten times the average in developing countries.\\nThe carbon footprint (or greenhouse gas footprint) serves as an indicator to compare the amount of greenhouse gases emitted over the entire life cycle from the production of a good or service along the supply chain to its final consumption.

Though the greenhouse effect is heavily driven by water vapor, human emissions of water vapor are not a significant contributor to warming.\\nAlthough CFCs are greenhouse gases, they are regulated by the Montreal Protocol which was motivated by CFCs' contribution to ozone depletion rather than by their contribution to global warming. Ozone depletion has only a minor role in greenhouse warming, though the two processes are sometimes confused in the media. In 2016, negotiators from over 170 nations meeting at the summit of the United Nations Environment Programme reached a legally binding accord to phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. The use of CFC-12 (except some essential uses) has been phased out due to its ozone depleting properties. The phasing-out of less active HCFC-compounds will be completed in 2030.\\n\\n\\n=== Human activities ===\\nStarting about 1750, indust\", metadata={'title': 'Greenhouse gas emissions', 'summary': 'Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities intensify the greenhouse effect.

The data used by the CDP scientists is a composite of quantities of emissions as described via the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard (GHGPCS): Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions (not including Scope 2) - these three being all the possible Scope-emission types. 1 is direct emissions sources from a companies owned or possessed resources, 3 is indirect sources subsequential from production activities; these are divided by GHGPCS into types: upstream and downstream, and 15 categories. Scope 3 emissions are thought to be approximately 90% of the total from any company  and result from the combustion of coal, and, or,  oil, and, or, gas during the conversion of these into energy i.e. as fuel; which is categorized as a downstream.

       " Document(page_content='Carbon offsetting is a trading mechanism that allows entities such as governments, individuals, or businesses to compensate for (i.e. “offset”) their greenhouse gas emissions by supporting projects that reduce, avoid, or remove emissions elsewhere. In other words, carbon offsets focus on offsetting emissions through investments in emission reduction projects. When an entity invests in a carbon offsetting program, it receives carbon credits, i.e \"tokens\" used to account for net climate benefits from one entity to another. A carbon credit or offset credit can be bought or sold after certification by a government or independent certification body.  One carbon offset or credit represents a reduction, avoidance or removal of one tonne of carbon dioxide or its carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e). \\nOffset projects that take place in the future can be considered to be a type of promissory note: The purchaser of the offset credit pays carbon market rates for the credits and in turn receives a promise that the purchaser\\'s greenhouse emissions generated in the present (e.g. a ten-hour international flight) will be offset by elimination of an equal amount at some point in the future (e.g. 10 to 20 years for planting 55 seedlings). Offsets that were generated in the past are legitimate only if they were in addition to reductions that would have happened anyway.A variety of greenhouse gas reduction projects can be used to create offsets and credits. These include forestry projects (avoidance of logging, sapling planting, etc.), renewable energy projects (wind farms, biomass energy, biogas digesters, hydroelectric dams, etc.), energy efficiency projects (more efficient cooking stoves, etc.), negative emission/carbon capture technologies (biochar, carbonated building elements, geologically stored carbon, etc.) and the elimination of methane emissions in  various settings such as landfills.\\nCarbon offset and credit programs provide a mechanism for countries to meet their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) commitments to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement included three mechanisms for “voluntary cooperation” between countries towards climate goals, including carbon markets. Article 6.2 enabled countries to directly trade carbon credits and other units such as gigawatts (GW) of renewable power with each other,  and referred to this as Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs). Article 6.4 established a new international carbon market allowing countries or companies to use carbon credits generated in other countries to help meet their climate targets.\\nCarbon offset and credit programs are coming under increased scientific and media scrutiny because their claimed emissions reductions may be inflated compared to the actual  reductions achieved. To be credible, the reduction in emissions must (1) last indefinitely (e.g. the newly planted forest must not be logged or susceptible to wildfires), (2) be additional to emission reductions that were going to happen anyway, and (3) be measured and monitored to assure the that the amount of reduction promised has in fact been attained.\\n\\n\\n== Definition ==\\nA carbon offset is a way of compensating for emissions of  carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases.

One carbon offset or credit represents a reduction, avoidance or removal of one tonne of carbon dioxide or its carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e). \\nOffset projects that take place in the future can be considered to be a type of promissory note: The purchaser of the offset credit pays carbon market rates for the credits and in turn receives a promise that the purchaser\\'s greenhouse emissions generated in the present (e.g. a ten-hour international flight) will be offset by elimination of an equal amount at some point in the future (e.g. 10 to 20 years for planting 55 seedlings). Offsets that were generated in the past are legitimate only if they were in addition to reductions that would have happened anyway.A variety of greenhouse gas reduction projects can be used to create offsets and credits. These include forestry projects (avoidance of logging, sapling planting, etc.), renewable energy projects (wind farms, biomass energy, biogas digesters, hydroelectric dams, etc.), energy efficiency projects (more efficient cooking stoves, etc.), negative emission/carbon capture technologies (biochar, carbonated building elements, geologically stored carbon, etc.) and the elimination of methane emissions in  various settings such as landfills.\\nCarbon offset and credit programs provide a mechanism for countries to meet their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) commitments to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement included three mechanisms for “voluntary cooperation” between countries towards climate goals, including carbon markets. Article 6.2 enabled countries to directly trade carbon credits and other units such as gigawatts (GW) of renewable power with each other,  and referred to this as Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs). Article 6.4 established a new international carbon market allowing countries or companies to use carbon credits generated in other countries to help meet their climate targets.\\nCarbon offset and credit programs are coming under increased scientific and media scrutiny because their claimed emissions reductions may be inflated compared to the actual  reductions achieved. To be credible, the reduction in emissions must (1) last indefinitely (e.g. the newly planted forest must not be logged or susceptible to wildfires), (2) be additional to emission reductions that were going to happen anyway, and (3) be measured and monitored to assure the that the amount of reduction promised has in fact been attained.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_offsets_and_credits'}),\n",

Both greenhouses and the greenhouse effect work by retaining heat from sunlight, but the way they retain heat differs. Greenhouses retain heat mainly by blocking convection (the movement of air).

       " Document(page_content='In Italy, widespread impacts of climate change are currently being felt. With an increase in extreme events such as heatwaves, droughts and more frequent flooding, Italy faces many challenges adapting to climate change.One such case of the impact of sea level rise is the need for the preservation of the coastal city of Venice, which is facing increasing issues due to the rising sea levels. The economic, social, and environmental impacts that climate change creates, and an increasingly problematic death toll from the health risks that come with climate change, is a great challenge for Italy.Italy was the first country to make education on climate change compulsory, and has included \"protection of the environment, biodiversity and ecosystems\" in the constitution in order to \"protect future generations\". Italy is part of the Paris Agreement, the EU Adaptation Strategy and a treaty with France for a reinforced bilateral cooperation which includes a common commitment to sustainable development, the defense of the climate and biodiversity, and the protection of the Mediterranean and the Alpine Arc.Italy is trying to adapt its consumption into a more sustainable model by turning to renewable energy and gradually eliminating fossil fuels.\\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\n\\n\\n=== Energy consumption ===\\nItaly is the 3rd largest consumer of energy in the European Union after Germany and France. Italy\\'s most used sources of energy are petroleum products such as petrol, and natural gas. Due to climate change, Italy has been increasing efforts to produce and consume more renewable or \"green\" energy to reduce their carbon emissions. Italy is highly dependent on imported energy; and is the second largest importer of natural gas in Europe which comes from Russia. Some electricity is also imported, including nuclear power from France.\\n\\n\\n=== Transportation ===\\nTransportation is the sector most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions in Italy. In 1990 Italy emitted about 100 million tonnes of CO2, emitting steadily more annually over the following 15 years, to almost 130 million tonnes in 2005. Emission levels drop drastically in 2010 and 2015, settling between 100 and 106 million tonnes of CO2 until 2019. In 2022, Forza Italia unsuccessfully attempted to weaken EU rules on car emissions.\\n\\n\\n=== Fossil fuels ===\\n\\n\\n=== Industrial emissions ===\\nEmissions in Italy has increased throughout the industrial age, however due to the demands of climate change and the effort to switch over to more renewable energy sources, Italy has managed to be on a downward curve for their emissions. From 1989 to about 2008, Italy was on the rise for emissions to about 600 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2, but has since decreased to under 500 Mt to around 450 Mt of CO2  in 2019. Most of their air pollution when it comes to CO2 emissions has come from their energy supply for electricity and second to that is from manufacturing.\\n\\n\\n=== Forests ===\\nSome forest has regrown on abandoned farmland. A new forestry strategy has been agreed and was published in 2022. Wildfires in Italy can be a problem.\\n\\n\\n== Impacts on the natural environment ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\nThe climate of Italy is experiencing rising temperatures, melting glaciers, an increase in the number of extreme floods due to sea rise and high rainfall, and more frequent and prolonged periods of drought.These climatic variations could be noticed in July 2021, when heavy rains were seen causing a lot of damage, while a month later the country experienced a record temperature, with a maximum temperature of 48.8 degrees, in Sicily putting 26 cities under red alert. These two phenomena reflect a changing climate in recent years.In addition to the increase in these extreme events, the changing Italian climate has seen a decrease in precipitation, such as the winter of 2022 which left Italy with one third less rain.

This will involve trying to train different machine learning models, to see how precisely these patterns can be used to predict how much carbon is emitted based on the correlating factors.\\nWe will try to answer the following questions: \\n\\n- Which are the most decisive factors for carbon emissions for an individual?\\n- Does internet usage directly affect total carbon emissions?\\n- Does the important factors differ between males and females?\\n- Does people who see themselves as \"energy efficient\" generally have lower total carbon emissions?\\n- Are the people travelling frequently by plane, the ones who are emitting the most carbon?\\n- Which machine learning methods did you choose to apply in the application?\\n- How accurate is your solution of prediction?\\n- Which were the challenges in the project development?\\n\\n# Data Preparation\\n\\n### Data Collection / loading:\\n\\n### Data cleaning and exploration\\n\\nIt looks like it follows a kind of skewed normal distribution, with a few outliers lying greatly above the mean\\n\\nThe biggest correlation with carbon emissions, seem to be the monthly travelled distance by personal vehicle. Other factor with clear correlations seem to be type of transport, vehicle type and frequency of travelling with airplane. There also seem to be a smaller correlation with the amount of clothes people buy.\\n\\nDoes internet usage have an impact on carbon emissions?\\n\\nThere is a slight correlation, but nowhere near enough to asser any tendencies. We are lucky computer people!\\n\\nLet\\'s see if theres as difference between male an female patterns\\n\\nThere doesn\\'t really seem to be a difference of how much the factors weigh between males and females\\n\\n### Outliers\\n\\nAs we can see, the distribution of distance travelled by vehicle is very skewed, with 75% of the data lying beneath 3000 km pr month, with quite a few outlier being outragerously above the median. This might still be an accurate representation though, since some individuals just might travel that much. \\nWe\\'ll keep it for the variance\\n\\nLet\\'s see if people are as accurate as they think, when they say they\\'re energy efficient!\\n\\nWe can see that people say that the are energy efficient generally tend to have a little bit lower carbon emission in total, but the difference really is only about 1,5% lower than the \\'No\\' category.\\n\\nThe total sum of carbon emissions seems to be higher by people declaring that they\\'re being energy efficient, indicating that a lot more people think they are being efficient than not, while not really making any difference in the emitted carbon dioxide!\\n\\n### Plane travel\\n\\nWe can see theres a small correlation between the Frequency of air travel, and their carbon emission, let\\'s sxplore what it means\\n\\nAs we can see, the distribution of people is fairly equal between all different categories of flight frequency, but there\\'s a clearly tendency of higher average carbon emissions from people who are in the \\'very frequent\\' category.\\n\\nThe mean carbon emssions are around 22% higher for people who travel very frequently by air.\\n\\n\\n## Supervised Machine learning\\n\\nLet\\'s try and see if we can predict total carbon emission values by training different classifier models.\\nSince we\\'re doing classification, we\\'ll bin the carbon emission numbers into categories\\n\\n### Model training\\n\\nThe XGBoost model looks to have the best accuracy, with a score of 0.9747 on the test set, with only a MAE of 123.98. This is more then likely beacuse of the model ability to be regularization, both L1 and L2 to handle overfitting. Not only that, but  also how its build on top of gradient boosting framework, tree pruning, handling missing values, cross-validation and parallel processing.\\n\\n#### Naive Bayes model\\n\\nAn accuracy of about 70 percent, not bad for a first try, but I think we can do better.\\nLet\\'s try to focus on the correlating values\\n\\n#### Validation\\n\\nIn the end, it made a bigger difference to adjust the test set size to around 15% of the set\\n\\n### Decision Tree Classifier\\n\\n#### Validation\\n\\nEven better than before. Maybe our predictions can be even more accurate by using several decision trees\\n\\n### Random Forest Classifier\\n\\n#### Validation\\n\\n### Classification summary\\n\\n**Iteration 1**\\n- No data normalization\\n- 5 equally divided bins <br />\\n\\n80% accuracy (RFC)\\n\\nAt 80% accuracy the random forest classifier seems to be the most accurate model we have tested. It seems to correctly categorize a lot of the lower emitting categories, and is a little less accurate on cases with fewer instances. It\\'s still making some big mistakes which might not show up in the overall calculated score, but is very significant.\\nFor example, none of the models have succesfully caught any people in the topmost carbon emitting category. Perhaps implying, that the category data sould be binned differently, becuase if only very few instances fit into the bin, the model might not have any chance of recieving enough training data to be able to recognize the extreme cases.\\n\\n**Iteration 2**\\n- Data transformed to normal distribution\\n- 4 equally divided bins\\n\\n87% accuracy (RFC).\\n\\nModel accuracy have improved in accuracy. I accredit this to the fewer bins and the now normal distribution of the data. Even though the accuracy seems higher, the result is still unsatisfactory since it fails to identify any extreme cases in both high and low end. Because of the normal distribution transform, the data have accumulated around the mean, resulting in only around 2% of the data fitting in the extreme bins. The training data might still be to sparse to let the model identify these few extreme cases\\n\\n**Iteration 3**\\n- Data transformed to normal distribution\\n- 3 equally divided bins\\n\\n92% accuracy (RFC)\\n\\nModel have once model improved in accuracy.

At the beginning, we chose to start with only one hidden layer and 32 neurons, and then each time increase neurons with the power of 2. We made the assumption that the max number of neurons in a layer should be 512 to avoid overfitting, beacuse we know that more neurons means that the model has a higher capacity to learn form the traning data; however we dont want the model to learn from noise and other irrelevant factors, which can lead to overfitting.\\n\\n#### Configuration\\n\\nThe 4 performance metrics of the neural network with varying configurations over 50 epochs of layers and neurons are shown in the table above. This config are defined by the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer. For all iterations, we chose the activations function: ReLU:\\n```math\\nf(x) = max(0, x)\\n```\\n\\n#### Results\\n\\nThe results show that the accuracy of the model increases with the number of layers and neurons. We can see that the accuracy of the model is 0.9819 with 4 layers (256, 512, 512, 512 neurons) The test loss is 109.2275 and the mean absolute error is 75.5905. This is the best result we have achieved with the neural network.\\nWe can also conclude that the neural network has better results the our XGBoost model, that \\'only\\' got an accuracy of 0.9747 and a MAE of 123.9864.\\n\\n\\n#### Alterantive improvements\\n\\nWithout a doubt, we know that our neural network has a good accuracy 0.9819 and a littel MAE on 75.5905. However, we can still alot of different was to try and improve the model.\\nThe different tings that can be experimaneted with are the following:\\n- The number of epochs\\n- The number of layers\\n- The number of neurons in each layer\\n- The activation function\\n\\n## Unsupervised machine learning\\n\\n### Applying the data to K-means, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN & Mean Shift\\n\\nThe perpose of applying these clustering models, is to see if, there are patterns in the data, that we haven\\'t been able to see ny the numbers only.\\n\\n### Hierarchical clustering\\n\\n### K-means\\n\\n#### Multible cluster model testing\\n\\n#### Clustering summary:\\n\\nWe have try using K-means, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN & Mean shift to see if there are any patterns in the data, but it seems that there are no clear patterns in the data, when applying these clustering methods to the hole dataset. We have tried with and without scaling the data. Additionally, we have tried to use different numbers of clusters, but the results are still the same. \\nThis is concluded based on the visualisation of the clusters from the different methods due to the visualistations being porly; However, the silhouette score have actually been quite high, which indicates that there are some patterns in the data.\\n\\nSilhouette score (without scaling and pca):\\n* K-means: 0.727 (with 2 clusters), 0.624 (with 3 clusters)\\n* Hierarchical clustering: 0.426\\n* Mean shift: 0.727\\n* DBSCAN: indicates one clusters in the data\\n\\nSilhouette score (without scaling and pca):\\n* K-means: 0.549 (2 clusters), 0.426 (3 clusters)\\n* Hierarchical clustering: 0.542 (2 clusters)\\n\\nWe have also tried using only some parts of the datas features, these results are gives som visualisation endication of patterns.\\nThe features used for the clustering are: \\'Monthly Grocery Bill\\', \\'Waste Bag Weekly Count\\', \\'How Long TV PC Daily Hour\\', \\'How Many New Clothes Monthly\\', \\'How Long Internet Daily Hour\\'\\n\\nSilhouette score (without scaling and pca):\\n* K-means: 0.79 (with 2 clusters), 0.727 (with 3 clusters)\\n* Hierarchical clustering: 0.698\\n* Mean shift: 0.597\\n* DBSCAN: indicates one clusters in the data\\n\\nOther features combinations have also been tried, but the results gives similar visualisation and silhouette score.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTheres much interesing information in exploring this dataset, and we can definetely find a lot of patterns that is crucial for identifying which personal lifestyle factors are significant when it comes to calculationg our total carbon emission output.\\n\\n**Here is our discoveries summarized:**\\n\\n- The most significant factors for an individuals carbon emission seem to be their choice of transport. People that drive many kilometers monthly in personal vehicles are also the one who have a tendency to have the highest carbon emissions.\\n\\n- Theres a small indication that internet usage has an impact on carbon emissions to correlating factors, but no direct pattern can be concluded, so we deem it as insignificant\\n\\n- There seem to be very little difference in the correlating factors between males and females\\n\\n- People who see themselves as \\'Energy efficient\\' only seem the emit about 1,5% less carbon than people who say they\\'re \\'Not energy efficient\\', which we conclude makes it insignificant\\n\\n- People who travel with airplanes very frequently seem to emit around 22% more carbon on average, than people who never fly\\n\\nWe tried to use different classification machine learning methods to try and predict carbon output based on correlating factors, and clustering methods for trying to discov hidden patterns in the data.\\n\\nFor classification we tried:\\n\\n- Naive Bayes classifier\\n- Decision Tree classifier\\n- Random Forest classifier\\n\\nWe tried several iterations for optimizing the models by adjusting the category amount and the normalisation of the input data. In the end, the RFC model was the most succesful, with an accuracy of aaround 92% with 3 categories. However, we deem the result as unsaticfactory, since the input data still is a bit unsuited for this kind of machine learning, with 92% of the data fitting into a single category. The good accuracy is due to overfitting.\\nOn the last iteration we tried to divide the categories by quantiles, which made the model drop to 67% accuracy, but is a way more useful and less overfitted model.\\n\\nFor clustering we tried: \\n- K-means\\n- Hierarchical clustering\\n- DBSCAN \\n- Mean shift. \\n\\nThese clustering models revealed no significant patters in the data, with the DBSCAN resulting in an optimal cluster amount of 1. Higest silhouette score was 0.79 for K-means with 2 clusters; however the visulaization of the clusters from the different models were poor, didnt give any further insight to the data in the form of given patterns. Only way to get better visualizations, was to use specific features and not the hole dataset. This was without a doubt one of the challenges in the project development.\\n\\n'),\n",

This central message is \\nechoed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s Special Report on the impacts of global warming \\nof 1.5-degrees (IPCC 2018), as well as the conclusion of the \\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions \\nGap Report 2020 which devotes a chapter to low-carbon \\nlifestyles (UNEP 2020). Further, the upcoming IPCC sixth \\nassessment report is expected to highlight demand and social \\naspects of mitigation (Creutzig et\\xa0al. 2018). At the country \\nlevel, national and regional governments now also incor -\\nporate lifestyle and behavior changes into their long-term \\nstrategies, in parallel with technological changes. Transfor -\\nmation to a net-zero economy is “not just about technologies \\n(…but) about people and their\\xa0daily lives” and “lifestyle \\nchoices can make a real difference, while improving quality \\nof life” (European Commission 2018) and “shifting the way \\nof life (…) provides a major impact directly and indirectly \\non climate change” (Government of Japan 2019).\\nIn terms of research on lifestyle changes and climate \\nchange mitigation, the body of literature has grown but is \\nstill limited. For example, emission pathways based on the \\nintegrated assessment models (IAMs) incorporate various \\naspects of lifestyle changes; however, these need to be devel -\\noped to more comprehensively explore the impacts of indi-\\nrect emissions through the lifecycle of goods and services \\n(van den Berg et\\xa0al. 2019; Saujot et\\xa0al. 2021).

GHG \\nemissions resulting from household consumption comprise \\n58–72% of total global emissions (Ivanova et\\xa0al. 2016; Her -\\ntwich and Peters 2009). These carbon footprints consist of \\nboth direct emissions, such as the use of fossil fuels at home \\nand for driving, and indirect emissions resulting from the \\nuse of goods and services by households—which can be \\neven higher than the direct ones (Hirano et\\xa0al. 2016). Recent \\ndevelopments in this field include attempts to quantify miti-\\ngation impacts from a variety of demand-side options related \\nto food, housing, and mobility (Jones and Kammen 2011; \\nSchanes et\\xa0al. 2016; Bjelle et\\xa0al. 2018; Wood et\\xa0al. 2018; \\nIvanova et\\xa0al. 2020; Moran et\\xa0al. 2020). Despite the ris-\\ning number of such studies, however, most focus only on \\nthe potentials based on individual demand-side options and \\noffer no concrete scenarios in the form of the aggregated \\nimpacts from lifestyle changes required to close the gaps \\nbetween currently prevalent heavy carbon footprints and the \\nclimate targets. Building on these existing approaches, the \\npresent study proposes a consumption-based target for life-\\nstyle carbon footprints and also explores the extents needed \\nto change lifestyles to meet the 1.5\\xa0°C climate target of the \\nParis Agreement.\\nThis paper proposes an approach for assessing lifestyle \\ncarbon footprints and lifestyle changes aimed at limiting \\nglobal warming to 1.5\\xa0°C and facilitating the transition to \\ndecarbonized lifestyles through participatory research. After \\nintroducing per-capita targets of lifestyle carbon footprints, it \\nprovides a hotspot analysis of current lifestyles and mitiga-\\ntion impacts from individual and multiple lifestyle change \\noptions, focusing on the case studies of Finland and Japan. \\nThe quantitative results discussed are based on the key find-\\nings from phase I of the “1.5-Degree Lifestyles” project, an \\ninternational research project on decarbonizing lifestyles, \\nand its technical report (IGES et\\xa0al. 2019). Building up to \\nthe quantitative analysis, it discusses research opportuni-\\nties including subnational analysis, living lab, and scenario \\nanalysis that could be followed up on to facilitate lifestyle \\nchanges that can be taken aimed at decarbonization.\\nConsumption‑based per‑capita targets \\ncorresponding to\\xa0the\\xa01.5\\xa0°C climate goal\\nThis section explains the different types of targets and their \\nrelevance. Typically, climate change targets have been \\ndiscussed in terms of territorial emissions such as at the \\ncountry level (Climate Analytics and NewClimate Institute \\n2020), but such accounting cannot comprehensively cap-\\nture the impacts of consumption activities through indirect emissions in supply chains occurring outside of the terri-\\ntory being studied. On the other hand, consumption-based \\ncarbon footprint accounting is useful for devising policies \\nthat avoid leakage of emissions beyond territorial bor -\\nders—an approach empowering governments, companies, \\nand consumers to shape low-carbon actions at the global, \\ncountry, city, and household levels (Peters 2010).\\nFurther, most existing targets are proposed at the \\naggregated level, such as global and country totals, but \\nin the context of promoting lifestyle changes, aggregated \\nterritorial-based targets may not be explicitly relevant to \\nhouseholds and local stakeholders, since such targets are \\nnot directly linked to people’s daily lifestyles or fail to \\naccount for the indirect emissions resulting from consump-\\ntion. Therefore, consumption-based per-capita targets can \\nfacilitate actions to decarbonize people’s lifestyles, and \\ncan also reveal the gaps between predominant lifestyles \\nand levels of decarbonization required to meet the targets.\\nIn this study, we define “lifestyle carbon footprints” as \\nthe sum of direct and indirect GHG emissions induced \\nfrom household consumption, excluding government \\nexpenditure and capital investment. In relation to the \\nplanetary boundaries (Rockstrom 2009; Steffen et\\xa0al. \\n2015), few studies have attempted to downscale climate \\nchange boundaries into per-capita targets (Nykvist et\\xa0al. \\n2013; Dao et\\xa0al. 2015). Further, these targets are static and \\nfail to account for the gradual reduction in carbon emis-\\nsions anticipated to take place by the second half of the \\ntwenty-first century, as suggested by the major mitigation \\npathways aligned with the climate goals (UNEP 2020). \\nFor these reasons, the present study established consump-\\ntion-based per-capita targets of lifestyle carbon footprints \\nassuming the gradual decrease of carbon budgets to the \\nsecond half of the century.\\nThe per-capita lifestyle carbon footprint targets proposed \\nbelow are based on a review of existing emission pathways, \\nprojections of global population (United Nations 2017), \\nand share of carbon footprints of household consumption \\nin total footprints (Hertwich and Peters 2009). As shown in \\nFig.\\xa01, using the identified representative pathways towards \\nthe 1.5\\xa0°C Paris Agreement goal, and considering either \\nlimited or intensive use of negative emission technologies \\n(van Vuuren et\\xa0al. 2018;\\xa0Ranger et\\xa0al. 2012;\\xa0Rockström et\\xa0al. \\n2017 ), the upper and lower annual targets of per-capita life -\\nstyle carbon footprints are: 2.5–3.2  tCO2e in 2030, 1.4–2.2 \\n tCO2e in 2040, and 0.7–1.4  tCO2e in 2050. It should be \\nnoted that, to explicitly focus on the parts related to lifestyles \\nof citizens, these targets do not include footprints result -\\ning from government expenditure and capital investment. \\nHowever, accounting for such factors in allocating footprints \\ncould be taken up in future research, as they are not only \\nfactors related to satisfying the needs of a country’s citizens \\nbut also those of future generations, as well as its exports.', metadata={'source': '../data/research_paper.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

In terms of the carbon budget, the latter is \\nclose to a 2\\xa0°C target with extensive use of negative emission \\ntechnologies.\\nAssessing hotspots of\\xa0lifestyle carbon \\nfootprints and\\xa0comparing them with\\xa0targets\\nHere, we explain the approach for assessing lifestyle car -\\nbon footprints, present the results of estimations, the gaps \\nbetween current lifestyle carbon footprints and the targets, \\nand the hotspot areas of lifestyle carbon footprints.\\nAssessing lifestyle carbon footprints through considera -\\ntion of different consumption domains and components \\ncan help to identify underlying problems and potential \\nsolutions. There are two basic approaches for estimating \\ncarbon footprints. One, used in most existing studies on \\ncarbon footprints related to household consumption, is \\nmonetary-based estimation (Hertwich 2005; Tukker et\\xa0al. \\n2010; Ivanova et\\xa0al. 2016). The other focuses on lifestyles \\nbased on physical amounts of consumption, for which \\nlimited studies exist (Barrett et\\xa0al. 2002; Nissinen et\\xa0al. \\n2007; Girod et\\xa0al. 2010; Moore et\\xa0al. 2013; Lettenmeier \\n2018). In our study, we mainly used estimation based on \\nphysical amounts of consumption, since it can more accu-\\nrately model substitutions between different consumption items—such as transportation modes, energy sources, and \\nfood ingredients. This approach also facilitates a better \\nunderstanding of the consumption patterns of citizens, \\nsince it examines carbon footprint hotspots on the basis of \\nboth physical consumption amounts and carbon intensities.\\nUsing the physical-amount approach, we examined car -\\nbon footprints and characteristics of consumer lifestyles \\nfocusing on food, mobility, and housing, and examined the \\namounts quantified based on actual physical amounts of \\nconsumption. The quantities estimated were based on fig-\\nures for mobility distance in passenger-km, food consump-\\ntion in kg, and energy consumption in kWh. For the other \\ndomains such as leisure, consumer goods, and services we \\nused monetary-based estimation, to ensure we had a fuller \\npicture, or overview of household consumption.\\nWe estimated carbon footprints of average consumers in \\nfive target countries, including Finland and Japan, for nutri-\\ntion, housing, and mobility domains based on the collected \\nnational and other official statistics, such as nutrition intake \\nand food supply, transport and fuel consumption, housing \\nand water supply, and energy statistics. To estimate carbon \\nfootprints for each product and service, we used carbon \\nintensity data obtained from life cycle inventory databases, \\nwhich are widely used and provide extensive coverage of \\nitems, such as Ecoinvent (Wernet et\\xa0al. 2016), as well as \\nadditional data on carbon footprints in other domains from \\ninput–output models such as ENVIMAT (Seppälä et\\xa0al. \\n2009) and GLIO (Nansai et\\xa0al. 2012). These carbon foot-\\nprints and physical consumption amounts were aggregated \\ninto several components per domain to enable comparison \\nbetween the target countries and quantification of the impacts \\nfrom lifestyle changes. More details on the data sources are \\navailable in the technical report (IGES et\\xa0al. 2019).\\nAssessing lifestyle carbon footprints and\\xa0gaps \\nwith\\xa0the\\xa0targets\\nResults of the analysis revealed significant gaps between \\ncurrent lifestyle carbon footprints and the 2030–2050 tar -\\ngets. Figure\\xa0 2 shows the estimated lifestyle carbon footprints \\nof average consumers in five countries, encompassing all \\naspects of household consumption—nutrition, housing, \\nmobility, consumer goods, leisure, and services—in com-\\nparison with the lower and upper targets. The results clearly \\npoint to the need for drastic and rapid reductions in lifestyle \\ncarbon footprints of 60–80% by 2030 and 80–90% by 2050 \\nin developed countries (Finland and Japan) and up to 40% \\nin 2030 and at least 20% to over 80% in 2050 in developing \\ncountries (China, Brazil, and India).Fig. 1  Lower and upper targets of per-capita lifestyle carbon foot-\\nprints in relation to meeting the 1.5\\xa0°C climate goal.

The estimated lifestyle carbon foot-\\nprints and physical consumption patterns were visualized \\nas skyline charts to examine the hotspots, and comparisons \\nwere made with the per-capita targets introduced in the \\nprevious section (Fig.\\xa0 3). For each colored block (rectan-\\ngle) in the figure, its area represents the carbon footprint \\nof the item, the width refers to consumption amount, and \\nthe height shows carbon intensity. The figure also shows \\ncurrent and indicative target carbon footprints, with dot-\\nted lines showing average intensities across components. \\nHere, the allocation of target carbon footprints between \\ncarbon intensity and consumption amounts as well as \\nbetween domains is only indicative, as different forms of \\nallocations are possible. Nevertheless, even an indicative \\ntarget can provide useful insights on the extent and cover -\\nage of the changes required to meet the related target.\\nThese visualizations enable an intuitive understanding \\nof the hotspots of lifestyle carbon footprints based on phys-\\nical consumption, either due to large carbon footprint (size \\nof the area) or high-carbon intensity (large height)—for \\nexample, consumption of meat, energy from fossil fuels, \\ncar-driving, and flights. Moreover, comparison with tar -\\ngets in each domain can deepen our understanding of the \\nlevels and types of changes in lifestyles and provisioning \\nsystems that will be required. To illustrate, in the mobil-\\nity domain, rapid reduction of both transport distance and \\nintensity may be needed to comply with the 1.5\\xa0°C target \\n(comparing the size of black, pink, and light blue dotted \\nline boxes).

To do this, we first \\nidentified the lifestyle change options that would have the \\nmost impact by literature review, then quantified around \\n30 options per country. Calculations were made based on \\nthe three approaches proposed above and the lifestyle car -\\nbon footprint and physical amounts of consumption esti-\\nmated in this study. Absolute reduction can be modeled \\nby reducing physical consumption amounts, and efficiency \\nimprovements can be reflected by reducing carbon intensi-\\nties in the dataset. Modal shifts can be quantified by shift-\\ning amounts of consumption of particular items to another \\nitem, as each has a different carbon intensity.\\nWe focused on quantifying the maximum potential of \\nfootprint reduction assuming full adoption (100% adop-\\ntion rate) of an option—for example, commuting without \\nany car or always eating vegetarian meals—but also show \\nresults for partial adoption of options. This is because in \\nthe real world, households are more likely to only make \\npartial use of commuting by bicycle or vegetarian meals, \\nor only a part of the population might adopt these options. \\nFigures for partial adoption were calculated by multiplying \\nfull implementation impacts by the adoption rate.\\nFigure\\xa0 4 shows the lifestyle change options identified. \\nThe most effective options include private travel with-\\nout a car, shifting to renewable electricity, electric cars, \\nvegetarian diets, and vehicle efficiency improvement \\n(potential of each option if fully implemented: 500\\xa0kg to \\nover 1500\\xa0kg  CO2e per capita on average). Other effective \\noptions include ridesharing, living close to the workplace, \\ntemperature control using heat pumps, commuting with-\\nout a car, use of dairy product alternatives, low-carbon \\nproteins, and living in smaller spaces (250–500\\xa0kg  CO2e \\nper capita).\\nThese results also highlight the importance of cover -\\ning all three approaches discussed in this paper: absolute \\nreduction, modal shift, and efficiency improvements. For \\nexample, many of the most impactful options with mitiga-\\ntion potentials over 500\\xa0kg  CO2e per-capita adopt the modal \\nshift approach, such as shifting from cars to public transport, \\nfrom conventional to renewable energy, from gasoline to \\nelectric cars, and from meat-rich to vegetarian diets, but also \\non the efficiency improvement approach, such as using effi-\\ncient vehicles and ride sharing. Absolute reduction options \\nare also prominent among the effective options identified, \\nsuch as reducing mobility distance, living space, and hot \\nwater consumption.\\nAs illustrated in the figure, the mitigation potentials differ \\namong the case countries. This implies that the effective -\\nness of lifestyle change options depends on each context, such as differences due to actual physical consumption pat-\\nterns, e.g., car driving, meat and dairy product consumption, \\nenergy consumption, and grid electricity mix. There are also \\nbackground reasons, such as different structures in provision, \\ninfrastructure, and habits of consumers. Therefore, options \\nsuch as car-free travel and dietary shift have larger mitiga-\\ntion potentials in Finland, whereas other options such as \\nrenewable electricity are more effective in Japan.\\nAggregated mitigation impacts from\\xa0lifestyle \\nchanges\\nTo better understand the level and types of demand-side \\nactions needed to meet the 1.5\\xa0°C climate goal, we investi-\\ngated lifestyle changes beyond the individual option of life-\\nstyle changes, through quantifying the aggregate mitigation \\npotentials from multiple options covering all the consump-\\ntion domains of food, housing, mobility, goods, leisure, and \\nservices. Adding up the impacts from more than one lifestyle \\nchange option does not produce accurate aggregate figures \\ndue to areas of synergy and overlap. Therefore, aggregated \\nimpacts from multiple lifestyle change options were quanti -\\nfied by considering the overlaps and synergies. As an initial \\nattempt to examine the level of required changes, we made \\na basic assumption that all selected options were adopted \\nat the same rate. The analysis results (Fig.\\xa0 5) revealed that \\n65–75% adoption of approximately 30 quantified options in \\ncombination with 65–75% reduction of footprints in goods, \\nleisure, and services by 2030 would be needed for both \\ncountries to comply with the upper to lower targets of 2030 \\n(2.5–3.2  tCO2e).\\nThis means that ambitious adaption of lifestyle change \\noptions can contribute to reducing lifestyle carbon foot-\\nprints towards the targets of the Paris Agreement. However, \\nthe level and coverage of required changes is both high \\nand broad due to the proximity of year 2030. In view of \\nthe 2050 targets, the analysis also concludes that even full \\nimplementation of these options with 90% reduction of \\nfootprints in goods, leisure, and services is not sufficient \\nto meet the 2050 lower target (0.7  tCO2e). This implies \\nthat much broader-ranging lifestyle change options and sys-\\ntemic changes, including large-scale behavioral changes \\ncombined with huge innovations in provisioning systems \\nmay be needed to comply with the 1.5\\xa0°C climate goal. \\nThese findings on aggregated mitigation impacts from the \\ncombination of multiple lifestyle change options under -\\nscore the need for ambitious uptake of currently available \\noptions and additional new decarbonization options, as \\nwell as structural changes in consumption habits and pro-\\nvisioning systems.', metadata={'source': '../data/research_paper.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

The quantitative analysis proposed above repre-\\nsents only an initial step, and further research is needed in \\nthis field. Recognizing that there are gaps between decar -\\nbonization targets and current lifestyle carbon footprints, \\nthere is a need for exploring how to fill them, through \\nincorporating lifestyle changes. The analysis of lifestyle \\ncarbon footprints in this paper identified means to reduce \\nGHG emissions derived from consumer lifestyles—abso -\\nlute reduction, modal shift, and efficiency improvement. \\nIn terms of implementation, the area to be focused on \\ngoing forwards is how to capitalize on these means to \\nsupport citizens, communities, governments, businesses, \\nand other stakeholders in transforming lifestyles and con-\\ntexts of living. This can be approached from three per -\\nspectives: clarifying the impacts from lifestyle changes \\nand the gaps with the target, envisioning possible future \\nbased on consumption-based scenarios and roadmaps, and \\nfacilitating lifestyle changes in real-life settings. To date, \\nfrom the footprint perspective, only a few existing stud-\\nies adopt the participatory approach, through stakeholder \\nworkshops (Leppänen et\\xa0al. 2012; Vita et\\xa0al. 2019). This \\nsection extends the footprint-based quantitative analysis to \\nincorporate these perspectives through subnational analysis \\non carbon footprints and lifestyle changes, integration with \\nliving lab approaches, and consumption-based scenario \\ndevelopment.\\nSubnational analysis of\\xa0lifestyle carbon footprints \\nand\\xa0lifestyle changes\\nOne opportunity as an area of study is analysis of lifestyle \\ncarbon footprints and lifestyle changes at the subnational \\nlevel. The availability of data related to household con-\\nsumption is growing—not only in the conventional format \\nof aggregated statistics of household consumptions at both country- and city-level but also covering different aspects \\nof household consumption, including survey microdata of \\nindividual responses to surveys. As illustrated in this paper, \\nquantifying mitigation potentials from lifestyle changes \\nhelp to understand the effectiveness and potential contribu-\\ntions of lifestyle changes to the climate goals. However, to \\ndate, most studies on the quantification of carbon footprint \\nreduction focus on countries or regions (Jones and Kam-\\nmen 2011; Schanes et\\xa0al. 2016; Bjelle et\\xa0al. 2018; Wood \\net\\xa0al. 2018; Ivanova et\\xa0al. 2020; Moran et\\xa0al. 2020), with \\nonly a few exceptions (Hersey et\\xa0al. 2009; Dubois et\\xa0al. \\n2019). Considering the pivotal roles of cities in activating \\nsustainable lifestyles and decarbonized societies (Peters \\n2010; Wright et\\xa0al. 2011; Bailey et\\xa0al. 2019), the assess-\\nment of lifestyle carbon footprints proposed in this paper \\ncould be extended to subnational units such as cities and \\nlocal communities.\\nA similar analysis can also be extended to quantify miti-\\ngation potentials from lifestyle changes in different con-\\nsumer segments using survey microdata. Previous research \\nbased on survey microdata covering carbon footprints of \\nhouseholds or consumer segments has revealed that they \\nvary widely, even within-country, by from 3 to 10 times \\n(Weber and Matthews 2008; Froemelt et\\xa0al. 2018; Koide \\net\\xa0al. 2019). This analysis approach is especially relevant \\nconsidering the growing awareness of the inequalities, in \\nterms of carbon footprints, between consumer and income \\nsegments globally and within each country, which under -\\nscores the urgency of addressing the emissions and foot-\\nprints of high-carbon population segments (Kartha et\\xa0al. \\n2020; Ivanova and Wood 2020; UNEP 2020). The segmen-\\ntation method in existing studies can be combined with the \\napproach proposed in this paper to investigate the impacts \\nof a transition in lifestyles of different consumer segments. \\nSuch analysis can identify mitigation potentials in terms \\nof high-carbon activities and high-carbon population seg-\\nments, which are both useful when considering the equita-\\nbility and effectiveness of mitigation actions.\\nIntegration of\\xa0lifestyle carbon footprint analysis \\nwith\\xa0living lab approaches\\nThere is a need to examine the feasibility of lifestyle \\nchanges, levels of potential acceptance by citizens, and \\nnecessary supporting measures and policy actions, as well \\nas assess the impacts from a carbon footprint perspective. \\nA deeper and more realistic understanding of lifestyle \\nchanges can be obtained from the living labs approach. \\n‘Living labs’ refers to an open innovation platform with \\nreal-life environments to address societal challenges \\nthrough the collaboration of various stakeholders (Hos-\\nsain et\\xa0al. 2019 ).

Living labs may contribute to generating \\nuseful applied knowledge and inspiring rapid transforma-\\ntions in society and technology, creating not only direct \\nimpacts at the niche level but also indirect impacts through \\nadjustment of policies and provision structures, as well as \\ndiffuse impacts on cultural and normative values of socie-\\nties (Schliwa et\\xa0al. 2015).\\nThe living labs approach has numerous applications in \\nlow-carbon urban development (Voytenko et\\xa0al. 2016) and \\ndaily practices related to domains of lifestyles such as food, \\nenergy, building, work, and product use (von Geibler et\\xa0al. \\n2014; Davies and Doyle 2015; Devaney and Davies 2017; Kivimaa et\\xa0al. 2017; Jensen et\\xa0al. 2018).

These experimentations with \\nreal-life settings can be combined with the methodology \\nproposed in this paper to better comprehend the practicality \\nas well as necessity of certain actions, to facilitate impact-\\nful lifestyle changes.\\nDeveloping consumption‑based mitigation \\nscenarios and\\xa0roadmaps incorporating lifestyle \\nchanges\\nAs this paper shows, examining aggregated impacts by com -\\nbining multiple lifestyle change options helps us understand \\nthe lifestyle changes that are needed to meet the climate \\ngoals. Desirable outcomes in the future can be approached \\nthrough development of future scenarios and roadmaps \\nincorporating carbon footprints and lifestyle changes. Aim-\\ning towards decarbonized lifestyles, such efforts could \\nincorporate three elements: (1) consumption-based carbon \\nfootprints and mitigation potentials from lifestyle changes \\nexplicitly linked to the decarbonization target, (2) partici-\\npatory process involving citizens and stakeholders, and (3) \\nroadmaps with supporting measures through policy and \\nstakeholder actions, as explained below.\\nFirst, scenario analysis can be based on consumption-\\nbased carbon footprints and explicitly indicate pathways to \\nthe decarbonization target. To date, a number of low-carbon \\nscenarios based on direct emissions incorporating the back -\\ncasting approach have been proposed (Hughes and Strachan \\n2010). However, these scenarios cannot fully account for \\nthe indirect impacts from consumption activities related to \\nlifestyles, due to the relatively large indirect emissions. Con-\\nversely, from a consumption-based perspective, some studies \\nquantified impacts from multiple demand-side options (Vita \\net\\xa0al. 2019; Moran et\\xa0al. 2020), but these studies do not focus \\non the gap with the decarbonization targets. Only a limited \\nnumber of scenarios of future lifestyles have been developed \\nthat comprehensively consider life cycle impacts and the \\ngaps with the target levels (Girod et\\xa0al. 2014; Lettenmeier \\net\\xa0al. 2014; Impiö et\\xa0al. 2020). These methods can be fur -\\nther expanded to incorporate consumption-based per-capita \\ntargets and the methodology of modeling lifestyle changes \\nproposed in this paper.\\nSecond, future scenarios linked with lifestyle carbon foot-\\nprints can be developed through stakeholder engagement \\nprocesses such as with citizens, the business sector, com-\\nmunity organizations, and policymakers. As the forms sus-\\ntainable lifestyles will take depend on the contexts (Akenji \\nand Chen 2016), so too will future decarbonized lifestyles. \\nStakeholder engagement can facilitate actions in policy \\nand business sectors by comprehensively considering the \\nimplications for lifestyles of citizens and environmental, \\neconomic, and social consequences. The scenario making process can be used as a tool for communicating with non-\\nscientific audiences and engaging stakeholders (Raskin \\net\\xa0al. 2004). Studies developing future lifestyle scenarios \\nwith stakeholder engagement (Leppänen et\\xa0al. 2012; Vita \\net\\xa0al. 2019) can be extended to explicitly link consumption-\\nbased footprint targets to investigate the desired types of \\ntransitions. Making use of such participatory processes can \\nensure the views of citizens and stakeholders are reflected \\nin the desired actions, to achieve a high quality of life within \\nclimate boundaries.\\nFinally, the extent and level of ambition of lifestyle \\nchanges required to meet the target necessitate supporting \\nmeasures and stakeholder actions. Unsustainable patterns of \\nconsumption are deeply embedded in contexts linked with \\neveryday routines and practices (Evans and Jackson\\xa0 2007; \\nSalomaa and Juhola 2020). Systems of provisioning linked \\nwith social practices have crucial roles beyond behaviors \\nof citizens (Spaargaren and Oosterveer 2009). Therefore, \\ninstead of placing overall responsibility entirely in the hands \\nof each consumer, a transition to decarbonized lifestyles may \\ninstead require systemic actions through all stakeholder \\nactions. This calls for supporting measures through new \\nsystems of provisioning as well as policies to enable decar -\\nbonized lifestyles, which can be identified and supported \\nthrough developing roadmaps alongside the scenarios.\\nScenarios are often combined with roadmapping of nec-\\nessary actions along with timelines, as illustrated in low-\\ncarbon society scenarios (Kainuma et\\xa0al. 2012), sustainable \\nlifestyle scenarios (Leppänen et\\xa0al. 2012; Impiö et\\xa0al. 2020), \\nand technology roadmapping (Hussain et\\xa0al. 2017). Stake-\\nholder dialogues such as workshops can help incorporate dif-\\nferent perspectives in roadmapping, as illustrated in existing \\nstudies (Doyle and Davies 2013). Roadmaps to support and \\nenable decarbonized lifestyles can include various instru-\\nments and actions related to consumer lifestyles, including \\neconomic, regulatory, information, nudging, infrastructure, \\nand product and service provision. These actions should \\ncover and focus on the carbon footprint hotspots related to \\nnutrition, housing, mobility, consumer goods, leisure, and \\nservices identified in this paper.\\nThe research opportunities discussed above are mutually \\nlinked and may have synergies. The subnational analysis of \\nlifestyle carbon footprints can provide a useful background \\nthat informs in the areas of equitability and effectiveness of \\nactions in the scenarios. In addition, options identified as \\npart of the scenarios through the participatory process can \\nbe tested in living labs to identify supporting measures and \\nconstraints in real-life environments, and the learnings from \\nthe living labs approach can be reflected into roadmaps.', metadata={'source': '../data/research_paper.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",

Considering the magnitude of changes required, life-\\nstyles need to be decarbonized based on a transformative \\napproach with a focus on non-incremental changes embrac-\\ning higher-order, larger-scaled, deep and impactful, systemic \\nchanges towards the long-term targets as proposed in this \\npaper. The findings from this paper confirm that focusing \\non impactful lifestyle changes in terms of carbon footprint \\nreduction potential is crucial, as pointed out by a previous \\nreview study (Wynes and Nicholas 2017). Despite the large \\nmitigation impacts expected from lifestyle changes, consumer \\nlifestyles are deeply embedded in complex cultural contexts, \\nsocial practices and provisioning systems. To address the \\nmagnitude of required changes, a transformation of lifestyles \\nmay need to employ mutually enhancing dual approaches, \\nthrough voluntary efforts and movements by citizens and \\nfacilitation through policies and stakeholder actions to sup-\\nport decarbonized options while discouraging unsustainable \\nones. This multi-stakeholder view can be facilitated through \\nthe research opportunities discussed in this paper.\\nImplementing the research opportunities discussed in this \\npaper may require a highly interdisciplinary approach, includ-\\ning but not limited to engineering, sociology, behavior sci-\\nences, economics, and policy sciences. Such research efforts \\ncan contribute to a transdisciplinary approach to advance \\nsustainability science and address its various complexities, \\nwhich include human behavior, norms and culture, and socio-\\necological systems (Shrivastava et\\xa0al. 2020). The approach \\nsuggested in this paper can be used to advance both academic \\nand practical knowledge on how to facilitate the transition of \\nlifestyles necessary to meet the 1.5\\xa0°C climate goal.\\nAcknowledgements This research was partially supported by the Finn-\\nish Innovation Fund Sitra, the KR Foundation, the United Nations’10-\\nYear Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and \\nProduction (10YFP), and the Environment Research and Technology \\nDevelopment Fund (JPMEERF16S11600) of the Environmental Resto-\\nration and Conservation Agency, Japan.

       " Document(page_content=\"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities intensify the greenhouse effect. This contributes to climate change. Carbon dioxide (CO2), from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, is one of the most important factors in causing climate change. The largest emitters are China followed by the United States. The United States has higher emissions per capita. The main producers fueling the emissions globally are large oil and gas companies. Emissions from human activities have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by about 50% over pre-industrial levels. The growing levels of emissions have varied, but have been consistent among all greenhouse gases. Emissions in the 2010s averaged 56 billion tons a year, higher than any decade before. Total cumulative emissions from 1870 to 2017 were 425±20 GtC (1558 GtCO2) from fossil fuels and industry, and 180±60 GtC (660 GtCO2) from land use change. Land-use change, such as deforestation, caused about 31% of cumulative emissions over 1870–2017, coal 32%, oil 25%, and gas 10%.Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main greenhouse gas resulting from human activities. It accounts for more than half of warming. Methane (CH4) emissions have almost the same short-term impact. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and fluorinated gases (F-gases) play a lesser role in comparison.\\nElectricity generation, heat and transport are major emitters; overall energy is responsible for around 73% of emissions. Deforestation and other changes in land use also emit carbon dioxide and methane. The largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions is agriculture, closely followed by gas venting and fugitive emissions from the fossil-fuel industry. The largest agricultural methane source is livestock. Agricultural soils emit nitrous oxide partly due to fertilizers. Similarly, fluorinated gases from refrigerants play an outsized role in total human emissions.\\nThe current CO2-equivalent emission rates averaging 6.6 tonnes per person per year, are well over twice the estimated rate 2.3 tons required to stay within the 2030 Paris Agreement increase of 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over pre-industrial levels. Annual per capita emissions in the industrialized countries are typically as much as ten times the average in developing countries.\\nThe carbon footprint (or greenhouse gas footprint) serves as an indicator to compare the amount of greenhouse gases emitted over the entire life cycle from the production of a good or service along the supply chain to its final consumption.

Though the greenhouse effect is heavily driven by water vapor, human emissions of water vapor are not a significant contributor to warming.\\nAlthough CFCs are greenhouse gases, they are regulated by the Montreal Protocol which was motivated by CFCs' contribution to ozone depletion rather than by their contribution to global warming. Ozone depletion has only a minor role in greenhouse warming, though the two processes are sometimes confused in the media. In 2016, negotiators from over 170 nations meeting at the summit of the United Nations Environment Programme reached a legally binding accord to phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. The use of CFC-12 (except some essential uses) has been phased out due to its ozone depleting properties. The phasing-out of less active HCFC-compounds will be completed in 2030.\\n\\n\\n=== Human activities ===\\nStarting about 1750, indust\", metadata={'title': 'Greenhouse gas emissions', 'summary': 'Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities intensify the greenhouse effect.

The data used by the CDP scientists is a composite of quantities of emissions as described via the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard (GHGPCS): Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions (not including Scope 2) - these three being all the possible Scope-emission types. 1 is direct emissions sources from a companies owned or possessed resources, 3 is indirect sources subsequential from production activities; these are divided by GHGPCS into types: upstream and downstream, and 15 categories. Scope 3 emissions are thought to be approximately 90% of the total from any company  and result from the combustion of coal, and, or,  oil, and, or, gas during the conversion of these into energy i.e. as fuel; which is categorized as a downstream.

       " Document(page_content='Carbon offsetting is a trading mechanism that allows entities such as governments, individuals, or businesses to compensate for (i.e. “offset”) their greenhouse gas emissions by supporting projects that reduce, avoid, or remove emissions elsewhere. In other words, carbon offsets focus on offsetting emissions through investments in emission reduction projects. When an entity invests in a carbon offsetting program, it receives carbon credits, i.e \"tokens\" used to account for net climate benefits from one entity to another. A carbon credit or offset credit can be bought or sold after certification by a government or independent certification body.  One carbon offset or credit represents a reduction, avoidance or removal of one tonne of carbon dioxide or its carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e). \\nOffset projects that take place in the future can be considered to be a type of promissory note: The purchaser of the offset credit pays carbon market rates for the credits and in turn receives a promise that the purchaser\\'s greenhouse emissions generated in the present (e.g. a ten-hour international flight) will be offset by elimination of an equal amount at some point in the future (e.g. 10 to 20 years for planting 55 seedlings). Offsets that were generated in the past are legitimate only if they were in addition to reductions that would have happened anyway.A variety of greenhouse gas reduction projects can be used to create offsets and credits. These include forestry projects (avoidance of logging, sapling planting, etc.), renewable energy projects (wind farms, biomass energy, biogas digesters, hydroelectric dams, etc.), energy efficiency projects (more efficient cooking stoves, etc.), negative emission/carbon capture technologies (biochar, carbonated building elements, geologically stored carbon, etc.) and the elimination of methane emissions in  various settings such as landfills.\\nCarbon offset and credit programs provide a mechanism for countries to meet their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) commitments to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement included three mechanisms for “voluntary cooperation” between countries towards climate goals, including carbon markets. Article 6.2 enabled countries to directly trade carbon credits and other units such as gigawatts (GW) of renewable power with each other,  and referred to this as Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs). Article 6.4 established a new international carbon market allowing countries or companies to use carbon credits generated in other countries to help meet their climate targets.\\nCarbon offset and credit programs are coming under increased scientific and media scrutiny because their claimed emissions reductions may be inflated compared to the actual  reductions achieved. To be credible, the reduction in emissions must (1) last indefinitely (e.g. the newly planted forest must not be logged or susceptible to wildfires), (2) be additional to emission reductions that were going to happen anyway, and (3) be measured and monitored to assure the that the amount of reduction promised has in fact been attained.\\n\\n\\n== Definition ==\\nA carbon offset is a way of compensating for emissions of  carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases.

One carbon offset or credit represents a reduction, avoidance or removal of one tonne of carbon dioxide or its carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e). \\nOffset projects that take place in the future can be considered to be a type of promissory note: The purchaser of the offset credit pays carbon market rates for the credits and in turn receives a promise that the purchaser\\'s greenhouse emissions generated in the present (e.g. a ten-hour international flight) will be offset by elimination of an equal amount at some point in the future (e.g. 10 to 20 years for planting 55 seedlings). Offsets that were generated in the past are legitimate only if they were in addition to reductions that would have happened anyway.A variety of greenhouse gas reduction projects can be used to create offsets and credits. These include forestry projects (avoidance of logging, sapling planting, etc.), renewable energy projects (wind farms, biomass energy, biogas digesters, hydroelectric dams, etc.), energy efficiency projects (more efficient cooking stoves, etc.), negative emission/carbon capture technologies (biochar, carbonated building elements, geologically stored carbon, etc.) and the elimination of methane emissions in  various settings such as landfills.\\nCarbon offset and credit programs provide a mechanism for countries to meet their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) commitments to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement included three mechanisms for “voluntary cooperation” between countries towards climate goals, including carbon markets. Article 6.2 enabled countries to directly trade carbon credits and other units such as gigawatts (GW) of renewable power with each other,  and referred to this as Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs). Article 6.4 established a new international carbon market allowing countries or companies to use carbon credits generated in other countries to help meet their climate targets.\\nCarbon offset and credit programs are coming under increased scientific and media scrutiny because their claimed emissions reductions may be inflated compared to the actual  reductions achieved. To be credible, the reduction in emissions must (1) last indefinitely (e.g. the newly planted forest must not be logged or susceptible to wildfires), (2) be additional to emission reductions that were going to happen anyway, and (3) be measured and monitored to assure the that the amount of reduction promised has in fact been attained.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_offsets_and_credits'}),\n",

Both greenhouses and the greenhouse effect work by retaining heat from sunlight, but the way they retain heat differs. Greenhouses retain heat mainly by blocking convection (the movement of air).

       " Document(page_content='In Italy, widespread impacts of climate change are currently being felt. With an increase in extreme events such as heatwaves, droughts and more frequent flooding, Italy faces many challenges adapting to climate change.One such case of the impact of sea level rise is the need for the preservation of the coastal city of Venice, which is facing increasing issues due to the rising sea levels. The economic, social, and environmental impacts that climate change creates, and an increasingly problematic death toll from the health risks that come with climate change, is a great challenge for Italy.Italy was the first country to make education on climate change compulsory, and has included \"protection of the environment, biodiversity and ecosystems\" in the constitution in order to \"protect future generations\". Italy is part of the Paris Agreement, the EU Adaptation Strategy and a treaty with France for a reinforced bilateral cooperation which includes a common commitment to sustainable development, the defense of the climate and biodiversity, and the protection of the Mediterranean and the Alpine Arc.Italy is trying to adapt its consumption into a more sustainable model by turning to renewable energy and gradually eliminating fossil fuels.\\n\\n\\n== Greenhouse gas emissions ==\\n\\n\\n=== Energy consumption ===\\nItaly is the 3rd largest consumer of energy in the European Union after Germany and France. Italy\\'s most used sources of energy are petroleum products such as petrol, and natural gas. Due to climate change, Italy has been increasing efforts to produce and consume more renewable or \"green\" energy to reduce their carbon emissions. Italy is highly dependent on imported energy; and is the second largest importer of natural gas in Europe which comes from Russia. Some electricity is also imported, including nuclear power from France.\\n\\n\\n=== Transportation ===\\nTransportation is the sector most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions in Italy. In 1990 Italy emitted about 100 million tonnes of CO2, emitting steadily more annually over the following 15 years, to almost 130 million tonnes in 2005. Emission levels drop drastically in 2010 and 2015, settling between 100 and 106 million tonnes of CO2 until 2019. In 2022, Forza Italia unsuccessfully attempted to weaken EU rules on car emissions.\\n\\n\\n=== Fossil fuels ===\\n\\n\\n=== Industrial emissions ===\\nEmissions in Italy has increased throughout the industrial age, however due to the demands of climate change and the effort to switch over to more renewable energy sources, Italy has managed to be on a downward curve for their emissions. From 1989 to about 2008, Italy was on the rise for emissions to about 600 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2, but has since decreased to under 500 Mt to around 450 Mt of CO2  in 2019. Most of their air pollution when it comes to CO2 emissions has come from their energy supply for electricity and second to that is from manufacturing.\\n\\n\\n=== Forests ===\\nSome forest has regrown on abandoned farmland. A new forestry strategy has been agreed and was published in 2022. Wildfires in Italy can be a problem.\\n\\n\\n== Impacts on the natural environment ==\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature and weather changes ===\\nThe climate of Italy is experiencing rising temperatures, melting glaciers, an increase in the number of extreme floods due to sea rise and high rainfall, and more frequent and prolonged periods of drought.These climatic variations could be noticed in July 2021, when heavy rains were seen causing a lot of damage, while a month later the country experienced a record temperature, with a maximum temperature of 48.8 degrees, in Sicily putting 26 cities under red alert. These two phenomena reflect a changing climate in recent years.In addition to the increase in these extreme events, the changing Italian climate has seen a decrease in precipitation, such as the winter of 2022 which left Italy with one third less rain.

       " Document(page_content='concluded that \"An atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature...\"John Tyn', metadata={'title': 'Greenhouse effect', 'summary': \"The greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases in a planet's atmosphere insulate the planet from losing heat to space, raising its surface temperature. Surface heating can happen from an internal heat source as in the case of Jupiter, or from its host star as in the case of the Earth. In the case of Earth, the Sun emits shortwave radiation (sunlight) that passes through greenhouse gases to heat the Earth's surface. In response, the Earth's surface emits longwave radiation (heat) that is mostly absorbed by greenhouse gases. That heat absorption reduces the rate at which the Earth can cool off in response to being warmed by the Sun. Adding to greenhouse gases further reduces the rate a planet emits radiation to space, raising its average surface temperature.\\nThe Earth's average surface temperature would be about −18 °C (−0.4 °F) without the greenhouse effect, compared to Earth's 20th century average of about 14 °C (57 °F), or a more recent average of about 15 °C (59 °F). In addition to naturally present greenhouse gases, burning of fossil fuels has increased amounts of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. As a result, global warming of about 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) has occurred since the Industrial Revolution, with the global average surface temperature increasing at a rate of 0.18 °C (0.32 °F) per decade since 1981.The wavelengths of radiation emitted by the Sun and Earth differ because their surface temperatures are different. The Sun has a surface temperature of 5,500 °C (9,900 °F), so it emits most of its energy as shortwave radiation in near-infrared and visible wavelengths (as sunlight). In contrast, Earth's surface has a much lower temperature, so it emits longwave radiation at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths (sometimes called thermal radiation or radiated heat). A gas is a greenhouse gas if it absorbs longwave radiation. Earth's atmosphere absorbs only 23% of incoming shortwave radiation, but absorbs 90% of the longwave radiation emitted by the surface, thus accumulating energy and warming the Earth's surface.\\nThe existence of the greenhouse effect, while not named as such, was proposed as early as 1824 by Joseph Fourier. The argument and the evidence were further strengthened by Claude Pouillet in 1827 and 1838. In 1856 Eunice Newton Foote demonstrated that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air, and the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide. The term greenhouse was first applied to this phenomenon by Nils Gustaf Ekholm in 1901.\", 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect'}),\n",

The recent rise in global  temperature is mostly due to emissions from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. There are various ways that mitigation can reduce emissions. These are transitioning to sustainable energy sources, conserving energy, and increasing efficiency. It is possible to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. This can be done by enlarging forests, restoring wetlands and using other natural and technical processes. The name for these processes is carbon sequestration.:\\u200a12\\u200a Governments and companies have pledged to reduce emissions to prevent dangerous climate change. These pledges are in line with international negotiations to limit warming.\\nSolar energy and wind power have the greatest potential for mitigation at the lowest cost compared to a range of other options. The availability of sunshine and wind is variable. But it is possible to deal with this through energy storage and improved electrical grids. These include long-distance electricity transmission, demand management and diversification of renewables.:\\u200a1\\u200a It is possible to reduce emissions from infrastructure that directly burns fossil fuels, such as vehicles and heating appliances, by electrifying the infrastructure. If the electricity comes from renewable sources instead of fossil fuels this will reduce emissions. Using heat pumps and electric vehicles can improve energy efficiency. If industrial processes must create carbon dioxide, carbon capture and storage can reduce net emissions.Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture include methane as well as nitrous oxide. It is possible to cut emissions from agriculture by reducing food waste, switching to a more plant-based diet, by protecting ecosystems and by improving farming processes.:\\u200aXXV\\u200a Changing energy sources, industrial processes and farming methods can reduce emissions. So can changes in demand for energy, for instance by moving towards low-carbon diets or more sustainable transport in cities. Urban planning and design are among the most effective tools in dealing with climate change, because they address both mitigation and adaptation.Climate change mitigation policies include: carbon pricing by carbon taxes and carbon emission trading, easing regulations for renewable energy deployment,  reductions of fossil fuel subsidies, and divestment from fossil fuels, and subsidies for clean energy. Current policies are estimated to produce global warming of about 2.7 °C by 2100. This warming is significantly above the 2015 Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 °C and preferably to 1.5 °C.

This action either reduces emissions of greenhouse gases or removes those gases from the atmosphere. The recent rise in global  temperature is mostly due to emissions from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. There are various ways that mitigation can reduce emissions. These are transitioning to sustainable energy sources, conserving energy, and increasing efficiency. It is possible to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. This can be done by enlarging forests, restoring wetlands and using other natural and technical processes. The name for these processes is carbon sequestration.:\\u200a12\\u200a Governments and companies have pledged to reduce emissions to prevent dangerous climate change. These pledges are in line with international negotiations to limit warming.\\nSolar energy and wind power have the greatest potential for mitigation at the lowest cost compared to a range of other options. The availability of sunshine and wind is variable. But it is possible to deal with this through energy storage and improved electrical grids. These include long-distance electricity transmission, demand management and diversification of renewables.:\\u200a1\\u200a It is possible to reduce emissions from infrastructure that directly burns fossil fuels, such as vehicles and heating appliances, by electrifying the infrastructure. If the electricity comes from renewable sources instead of fossil fuels this will reduce emissions. Using heat pumps and electric vehicles can improve energy efficiency. If industrial processes must create carbon dioxide, carbon capture and storage can reduce net emissions.Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture include methane as well as nitrous oxide. It is possible to cut emissions from agriculture by reducing food waste, switching to a more plant-based diet, by protecting ecosystems and by improving farming processes.:\\u200aXXV\\u200a Changing energy sources, industrial processes and farming methods can reduce emissions. So can changes in demand for energy, for instance by moving towards low-carbon diets or more sustainable transport in cities. Urban planning and design are among the most effective tools in dealing with climate change, because they address both mitigation and adaptation.Climate change mitigation policies include: carbon pricing by carbon taxes and carbon emission trading, easing regulations for renewable energy deployment,  reductions of fossil fuel subsidies, and divestment from fossil fuels, and subsidies for clean energy. Current policies are estimated to produce global warming of about 2.7 °C by 2100. This warming is significantly above the 2015 Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 °C and preferably to 1.5 °C. Globally, limiting warming to 2 °C may result in higher economic benefits than economic costs.Globally, financial flows for climate mitigation and adaptation are estimated to be over $800 billion per year, while requirements are predicted to exceed $4 trillion per year by 2030.\", 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation'}),\n",

Methane', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions', 'summary': 'Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities intensify the greenhouse effect. This contributes to climate change. Carbon dioxide (CO2), from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, is one of the most important factors in causing climate change. The largest emitters are China followed by the United States. The United States has higher emissions per capita. The main producers fueling the emissions globally are large oil and gas companies. Emissions from human activities have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by about 50% over pre-industrial levels. The growing levels of emissions have varied, but have been consistent among all greenhouse gases. Emissions in the 2010s averaged 56 billion tons a year, higher than any decade before. Total cumulative emissions from 1870 to 2017 were 425±20 GtC (1558 GtCO2) from fossil fuels and industry, and 180±60 GtC (660 GtCO2) from land use change. Land-use change, such as deforestation, caused about 31% of cumulative emissions over 1870–2017, coal 32%, oil 25%, and gas 10%.Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main greenhouse gas resulting from human activities. It accounts for more than half of warming. Methane (CH4) emissions have almost the same short-term impact. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and fluorinated gases (F-gases) play a lesser role in comparison.\\nElectricity generation, heat and transport are major emitters; overall energy is responsible for around 73% of emissions. Deforestation and other changes in land use also emit carbon dioxide and methane. The largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions is agriculture, closely followed by gas venting and fugitive emissions from the fossil-fuel industry. The largest agricultural methane source is livestock. Agricultural soils emit nitrous oxide partly due to fertilizers. Similarly, fluorinated gases from refrigerants play an outsized role in total human emissions.\\nThe current CO2-equivalent emission rates averaging 6.6 tonnes per person per year, are well over twice the estimated rate 2.3 tons required to stay within the 2030 Paris Agreement increase of 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) over pre-industrial levels. Annual per capita emissions in the industrialized countries are typically as much as ten times the average in developing countries.\\nThe carbon footprint (or greenhouse gas footprint) serves as an indicator to compare the amount of greenhouse gases emitted over the entire life cycle from the production of a good or service along the supply chain to its final consumption. Carbon accounting (or greenhouse gas accounting) is a framework of methods to measure and track how much greenhouse gas an organization emits.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Greenhouse gas emissions'})]"
