## Problem Statement:

Since carbon emissions have such a big impact on the greenhouse effect, every caution must be made to try and minimize these as mush as possible.
In this analysis we will try to identify patterns in normal individual peoples lifestyle factors, that contribute to their total carbon emissions, to make people more aware of how their lifestyle affects the climate.

## Context and Purpose:

In a world of climate change, it is important to reflect on the different things that affect this phenomena,
to understand it better, and realize it's consequences

The purpose of this analysis, is to better understand how the indivual lifestyles affect total
carbon emissions.
to understand how individual people can help the environment by being aware of how their lifestyle
affect these carbon emissions.
Make it easier for normal people to make educated decisions on how to have a more positive impact on the climate.

It can help researchers understand how and how much individals traits and/or lifestyle choices, affect total carbon
emissions

It can help society educate people on lifestyle choices and discourage harmful behaviours.

## Research Questions and Hypotheses:

- Can an individuals carbon emissions be predicted by their lifestyle factors?
- Which lifestyle factor have the biggest impact on carbon emissions?
- How can this information be used by individuals and the society for reducing carbon emissions?

H0 = an individuals carbon emissions have no relation to their lifestyle factors

H1 = an individuals carbon emissions can be predicted by their lifestyle factors

H2 = The most important factor for an individuals carbon emission is their style of transport

H3 = The information have clear tendencies, and can make it easy for people to understand how their lifestyle
affects their carbon emissions

H4 = Society can rely on the accuracy of this information for encouraging and/or discouraging behaviours of
individuals

H5 = Time spent on the internet has a significant impact on an individuals carbon emissions

## Expected Solution:

We expect that the information this analysis provides will create insight for individuals and instances in society,
to better understand how their lifestyle contributes to total carbon emissions

## Potential Impact and Users:

In correctly identifying lifestyle factors, it might be easier for individuals to make educated choices, which have lower carbon emissions.
Society would benefit from this information, because it would make it more clear to campaign what behaviours should be encouraged and discouraged.

## Execution Plan:

This project will be executed in 4 sprints, a sprint is 1. week period (approximately):

- **Sprint 1:** Problem Formulation
- **Sprint 2:** Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Sprint 3:** Model Development and Testing
- **Sprint 4:** Deployment and Usability Evaluation

| Sprint | Start Date | End Date   | Goal                                |
